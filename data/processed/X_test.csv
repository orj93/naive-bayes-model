review
confusing i used the app to import important notes from another smartphone note book to my current phone  although it transferred the information  it is so hard to find it    it disappeared completely
i can t restore history messages with latest version 6 3 8   i cannot find the backup and restore button   it is not in the general and also not under chat   the new chat history is only meant for migration to another phone  i can t restore wechat history from the same phone   why is that feature being remove   it was there last time   please put back that feature 
can t install  error code   505  have samsung galaxy note edge  had issues and couldn t update so i uninstalled the app and now i can t reinstall it  total bs 
good ui ux and helpful in governance looking the fact that indian government specially indian railway and its officials are using twitter app rigorously for assistance and services   i am installing it  twitter is changing the way of governance in world s biggest democracy india  team twitter should also look to make twitter better and friendly for governance point of view  if any possibility persists for same 
every time i press the send button  a black background appears  this doesn t happen before the update  it sucks coz it forces whatever i m doing to stop  like watching videos 
utter garbage didn t think i would be saying this as i m a firefox user myself  but the browser is utter garbage  i ve got a samsung galaxy tab s2 and the browser crashes constantly  i m switching to a different browser   
almost  but not quite  this has so much potential  but i really would like a back function that works  i press back and wait  nothing happens  i press back again and it takes me to the homepage   same for the back button on the tablet   i m using a 1st gen nexus 7 
      new ui looks good but still laggy and unstable and wtf with ads       
erroneous app    the wechat app is not loading my location data and therefore i m not able to find people nearby  the previous version used to work fine in my droid but the new version is irritating me a lot  now  this app is of no use if i can t explore new friends in my locality    
every company should use slack i don t usually give 5 stars  but man  slack is great for group company communication  in the office  at home  and on the go  takes a bit of getting used to but is well worth it 
dear google hate how tabs work on samsung galaxy s6  i want to keep my tabs open  because i watch 10 series at once  i don t want to have to reopen all the tabs every time i open up chrome  i have a habit of closing all running apps to save ram usage  please make the tab feature the same as on the old s4  
i can t see and upload my photo at the moment    why  before this  wechat no problem but now   why 
the new theme is not compatible with my device     samsung galaxy j1  make it compatible please  i really love this game 
good
would like to see who are currently online  performance of the latest app has deterioted  where is the list of online friends  one of the most important aspects of gtalk which never let me shift to other chats is the fact that i can know who all are online and i can chat with  by chat i mean i can get replies and have a conversation   please incorporate this feature at the earliest so that i can install this back 
good time waster  good fun  but getting old and spams ads really bad 
hasn t loaded in almost 16 days  have played everyday for 2 years and now it wont let me play at all  im sure all my saved up loot and hundreds of trophies have been lost during this time 
new update sux  no more dead bases  no more farming  you re almost often match with the same th level or higher  new shield system sucks too 
its not safe it has a link to gallery and file manager also   so anone can easily get access to my private photos without any password or restriction
very user friendly  for those looking for a straight forward note taking app that syncs across devices and has user friendly features  look no further  evernote simplified my electronic note taking with charm
makes top left of my screen unresponsive many lg v10 users lose the ability to tap the top left of their screen when this app is installed  this issue makes uses other apps impractical and sometimes impossible as this issue holds phones hostage  if fixed i ll change my review to 5 stars 
why is there so much space  there is so much white space and everything is so spaced out  also the notifications are always late 
looks great  works well and supports ubuntu  but needs removable storage support  an application like this is only as good as the service behind it  and this is where dropbox excels   it works flawlessly  securely and even has a native client available for linux based operating systems  ubuntu and steamos   my only real complaint is the lack of support for removable storage  such as micro sdxc memory cards   for which a star is lost   
bye to coc my th9 and no loot option after th9  i found the only 1lac loot or less  when someone attack on my clqn  they got more then 2lac  not possible to upgrade any thing 
angry birds what looks easy can demand a bit of skill  the player may become frustrated  but is never bored  i always find angry birds a great way to pass the time  most adverts allow a skip click 
still no notifications ugghh    please fix cant talk to people if you don t k ow you have a message and have to click hangout for it to load or send a message to see what you received           used to be a great app for my galaxy note 2 now its just blah its sad i used hangouts for phone and my chrome book   now it don t work for my phone and  only works for the chrome once in a while         please please ease fix notification and become a 5 star app again
nice update really nice update this update is awesome  but the quick search is really usless  but its okay  keep up the good works      
contact image disappears idk y i can t c the newly added contacts pliz fix dis i ll give u 5 stars straight away
immediate action needed  on clicking a link    it now shows tab saved in firefox  tap to open now  instead of opening directly   this is not good feature and lot more people also do not like it  do change it
why can t i share my achievements  recently discovered that there is a feature for sharing any kind of achievement  however i can t accomplish it on my profile
contacts name and pic i wanna know why alot of my new contacts just don t appear only appears if they are online or not and their pic and status don t     can this problem be solved   
      hanging so much even i am using higher end mobile having 3gb ram itself pls take the needfull action and fix that error
i think this game is such a load of rubbish it tries to con you into buying stuff from the instore app and cause you dont buy anything then you can be stuck on one part of the game for ages worsed app ive ever come across
what is the point of having the jackpot when we spin the wheel if i never get it i mean has anyone ever got the jackpot if not i think it s completely pointless and should be taken off
cannot cast to chromecast of all the apps that chromecast supports  chrome browser is not supported  why  how am i supposed to cast my browser  use firefox  or worse wait for ie  fix it already chrome  come on 
whatsapp i use this app now that blackberry messenger has basically gone away  my friends   family live all over the world  this really helps keep us in touch 
best app i can t believe that it is free  they treat it as if you paid for it 
good as far as i have it fast and reliable  for now  only thing is that scroll speed is somewhat faast  but thats mayth be due some option in phone maybee
simply brilliant simply brilliant  no problems so far   the best feature of this is the accordion of tasks that are grouped   could not login with google but simply clicked forgot password and set a new password and it worked perfectly as described in both the description and app   cheers 
even though i am loving the new update  but this breaks the default contacts app on the note 5  under accounts linkedin sync has no account header name and that breaks editing of contacts   update  opened a ticket with linkedin support and they agreed that the contacts app break on merged contacts is a bug  this is with their engineering team to be fixed  update2   contacts force close exists as off version 4 0 11  update3   finally the contacts bug has been fixed 
good app for call and texting  overall everything is ok  most important thing is that the battery not drained fast when you online  please add android auto support and i will rate it 5 stars 
needed to learn the hard way about town hall penalty if you attack an opponent with 1 level lower town hall you get 50  of loot  2 levels 25  and it decreases hence forth   i am a newbie no where in the tutorial its mentioned
fonts why in the heck is this thing analysing my fonts    not really quick browsing when i have to wait 5minutes for the fonts to load  are you asking my opinion  avoid this  terrible
pop up and search using image  i seriously hate that opera mini does not support pop ups  i need pop ups enabled  from where do i choose to enable it  i am forced to use uc browser due to this    and please provide an option in the long press menu to search using any image  please guys     we are waiting     reply atleast     
newest version doesn t receive push notifications had to revert to original hangouts app until this is fixed 
back to greatness previously couldn t compose a single message before the app crashed  dev s fixed issue very quickly  well done 
bug fixes required this version is much better than the previous one in terms of ui design  and data compression  this version gives me at least 86  saving  the saved pages view is good  as well as the tab previews  please provide an option to disable vibration for the facebook push notifications  and fix the in built wikipedia search engine language  every time i search for something through it  the page appears in german  i have to manually go to the english version of the page and search  please fix this 
light  fast  and comfortable apps when i compare 3 different browser  watch speed connection  ram and cpu usage then i know opera and their products is very good for smartphone and pcs
fantastic love it this is the best browser on the market i v tried most of the others and they dont come close keep up the good work     
all nepali must use
makes life better evernote has saved my bacon multiple times because i could easily find a picture of my drivers license or info on airline clubs or a receipt i needed   i used to keep info like that in contacts and it is much more difficult to search for that way and it clogs up your contacts   plus you can save screenshots  websites  pictures   anything   and they are searchable 
works really well slack for android works flawlessly on my nexus 7 and is way better to use than the ios and desktop versions  the latest update has fixed a couple of the ui ux issues introduced in the previous update and glad to see the scrollbar s back when you swipe up to view the channel history 
awesome
causes android device to not register touch this app has been causing issues making it so we can t use the upper left menu of our devices  multiple people have reported this and it is caused by your app please fix this and i will rate 5 stars 
still no widget  come on  i used to use this for all of my sms  not anymore  unacceptable   instead of adding a new welcome screen with latest update  they should have brought back the widget
fixed sticky notification    but can t sign in    the stick notification is not displayed is fixed thank u    but can t log in please help
outstanding this app is not only fabulous on android platform but also popular  this is the first app which can be useful for all people 
err    how do i back up and restore chat history  i used to be able to do that in older versions  why would you remove such a crucial feature   even after trying to backup using windows wechat  you have no idea where the backup is  it says backup on phone  but where on phone   if it s on the phone s internal storage then that s useless to me  cause i need to wipe it clean to reinstall the system  if it s on the sdcard  then where   comparing to the backup restore feature of whatsapp  wechat s is an absolute joke  
error i can t log in  its says error occured while logging in please try again later  i tried it several times  restarted my wifi and phone  still can t log in  please fix it   
videos and notifications my videos haven t been working for a long time on this app  whenever i try to watch a video someone else has posted  its black and white and all glitchy  i sometimes have no way of fixing it  next  i haven t been getting notifications in the app  i get them on my status bar  but when i go on the app i don t get a little number by the bell 
fix it dammit  why is my push notifications not appearing  i have 125 people enabled but i only get a tweet for every 5 minutes instead of all of them at the same time  i reinstalled the app countless times but they don t appear ar all  ive already missed 20 tweets in other 1 minute and i shouldve got notified for them all but i only got 1 for 1 tweet  fix this update im not liking it 
     when  i open it download but it stop when it reaches to the letter o and it wont move even if there is strong connection please fix it i really want to play
i cant find near by people around me  unable to load location data fix asap 
great game  but too many ads almost not worth playing 
wechat wallet still disappears people have been using wechat wallet in the english ios app for ages now with no problems  and yet when i put my android wechat app into english  wallet disappears  please fix the english android app so that wallet doesn t disappear when i change language from chinese to english  wechat wallet is incredibly useful  but only when you can actually use it 
was great  broken with marshmallow i lauded evernote for working across more devices and os than other products  but dropping stars as with android 6  if you format sdcard as internal  required to effectively use sdcard for apps and games   evernote will not run  it asks for a  memory card  
error i cannot edit my post with pictures  the moment i do  it will not change after save and it appears like when ur uploading but not yet done post in news feed and still there until i did reinstall the app  this still happens even 
install and reinstall the app but cant go back to the previous version   pls new version is so annoying  no more options for the contacts to set up if just want viber contacts only to appear  all contacts were shown even not using viber  pls fix
wonderful apps i have downloaded this apps in my cellphone  its very good apps for those who loves nepali language  great apps 
force close   im using asus fonepad k004 model  after last update june my app always keep force close  try reopen then failed again  until this new update still occur  any solution already try old version but still the same  hope will be improvised  thanks you
where s my boosters  after the update all the boosters i gained has gone  i had more than 100 boosters from each and now you took them all  why   
nice easy way to known about every things 
great app  but one problem ruins it i love the firefox for android  it s fast and efficient  and all the addons are great  yet  the menu key problem ruins the app  firefox will automatically turn on or off the menu key based on if it detects a hardware menu button  the only  problem is it gets it wrong sometimes  and there s no way to force it 
glitch y i like this browser better than chrome in terms of its setup and function  but i wish it was less glitchy  the back button seems to just lock up the tab on a certain website    sad face 
old version was better this new version needs lots of work  find web pages take much longer to load  can t tell it not to remember passwords for all sites 
really cool and organized  the new update is really amazing  the widgets are cool  however  it would be helpful if you could add right to left reading and writing support  like hebrew   cause when i want to add check box the text removed to the left   also  you need to add an option to change the size of the preview  don t like it s so small   and app animations would be nice  something else to your attention  i want to by the app  but it really  really  expensive  if it was cheaper and one time charge i would buy it 
some problems on showing pics after download android 5 1 1 can wechat team have the troubleshooting procedure  i viewed the previous standard tips from wechat tencent  it didn t work at all 
richard perez like it moved it to sd card and couldn t get it back now trying to re download for like three hours out of high speed data and can t connect to wifi don t know why or if download going to be complete should have waited before i rated it four stars 
camera roll please can you stop the camera roll popping up at top of page    whenever it does i can t use the app or my phone for a few mins    doing my nut in
my husband and i can t send msgs to each other  it s saying on both ends that one other ain t receiving msgs at this time   one messenger we can t recover to see if msgs got blocked   help fix this
some time creating problm network problm it seems err more reasons showing  
good app and nice try dear  developers great job done but i would suggest u to get an idea with  fleksy keyboard app also  for then not only me you shall get 5  rating from all around the world also i would suggest you should make easy standard keys for hamro keyboard  all the best and hope you will update new innovative idea for this app soon since i have suggested this app most of my frenz in nepal and overseas and since this app is one of the best app of mine i want to see more 5  for this app since you r the creator     
it s good i had typed up a longer review but then play store decided to crash    i ll just say that firefox for android feels faster and more stable than the default chrome browser  also the ui is less clunky 
aa nice
i remember back when this was a   3 ipod app not filled with bullshit like adds and powerups  go back to what you used to be   rio ruined every other angry birds game 
why can t google get it for a company being the most used internet search engine you would think google would be smart enough to conjure a team up to fix these problems they have  i also agree with a few others who thinks google messages and hangouts should combine somehow to make it work how the iphones imessage works
unable to change alert sound  not in options   unable to enable alerts per channel  on all or keywords and direct    closer to a beta than an app 
help me        my ipad had a software so i lost my base  i need it back  please  i left my base in a clan that shows my code on the top left on my profile  now i have 2 accounts please if any can help me i would really love this game  but at the moment nobody is helping me  thank you very much i hope you reply and i get my account back

emoji      hey bro  please add more emotions  can emotions be little bit larger in resolution   your app s assets consist more emoji but are not loading in app  there should be a way to flip to next emoji page 
privacy you must provide system in which no one should be able to download profile image  moreover if there will be video calling option then 5 rating is must  kindly do the needfull   
garbage  no user choice allow users to lock the toolbar  it makes no sense to hide the url just for a tiny bit of extra vertical space on big screens  also needs option to show tabs on top rather than in a separate screen for the same reason  still no pdf support   finally  stop unloading tabs when there are gigabytes of free ram  overflow menu is a cluttered mess 
neat idea  but let down by no linux support  an application like evernote is only as useful as the service behind it  and the service behind a concept like evernote is only as useful as the availability of an application or program to connect to said service    which is where evernote fails   it is not natively available for linux based operating systems  such as ubuntu   sure  the android application works well enough   but when the only way to access evernote under a linux based operating system is via a web browser  it quickly looses its appeal 
only miss cache to be bought 
great  keep it up  i ve been using uc mini for quiet a while and i have to say that you guys have done a great job  i have a 2g phone with low storage so it was hard for me to use youtube but you guys made my problem go away great job keep it up 
update sucks i have some friends who didn t play coc anymore  and their villages seems to forced out from search system  so there is no more loot in clash after the latest update  i can t upgrade my village and labratory  i think if supercell don t take care of this issue  they will lose a lot of players soon 
account creation issue i tried to create an account but it keeps saying can t create an account at this time
way to ruin it  this game was good at one point   i supported this game with real money   if you can t say anything nice  i hope other people can find a good time playing this 
free the gifs not reliable on a slower network   messages frequently don t send
why we have to use this  google we think its a time to make some changes in your team  who is planning and making this horrible aps  is apple or microsoft paying you for that   what s about dark theme for the beginning for this useless app   and make ability for sending files pls  make everything in one place  we don t need dozen usless aps 
 1 great game  challenging to the point where you don t want to give it up  great thing while you re bored  waiting or just want to play  can t stop playing  great job rovio 
not usable no matter what i try  i cannot save images from web pages  it downloads the  html files instead of  jpeg
nice apps
i don t get notifications from people anymore  also  the number of notifications i got doesn t go away after i have checked it  it kind of just    stays there 
this has made my life hell   it really sucks my cell hanged most of the time when it was there needs to improve so much            
there s a draught in th11 supercell needs to fix the draught caused by this update  this game is no longer fun  there s no loot to upgrade or donate  let th11s hit lower level bases  dead bases are dead  we re not wiping them  just going for collectors  this is the only way
ui   customization dark theme and color options  reply directly from the notification panel  options to change contact photos to initials and hide the timestamps  please bring back the gesture that takes you back to the conversation list by swiping from the left edge  write a message area is too cluttered  make it simplistic with a   sign  replace visible phone number with the name of the contact in send sms to   
not supported your new updated temple run 2 frozen shadows map is not supported to my device which is the samsung galaxy v  ill give 5 stars if you will make this updated map support my device plss i need to play that map  ive been waiting this for a couple of months
update few things     uc mini is very speed for dwnldng and other things  and plz provide an option for online videos dwnldng and youtube dwnldng  i hope iam expecting this feature from you as soon as 
still not background refreshing despite the daily updates this had been working well until a recent version  it no longer refreshes in the background and therefore is very slow to load when i open the app  stop updating things that used to work 
disappointed first of all i d like to thank the creators of the uc browser for this is the best browser that i have ever used  now why 3 stars  because i was planning to download a game but uc browser can t download it  the page loads but no downloads and i have to use mozilla because of this particular reason  i want to give you guys a five star but until you fix this i will just give you 3 star   thank you     just please help me with  this one i want to use only one browser 
why what s app does not support same account on multiple devices that s security but that s not good i buy a new phn sometimes i used to go with any phn then i have to switch to that that s not good should support same account on multiple devices
i love this app i love this app   its better than before now   
more than notes  just use it for notes  but it is a powerful app  like the checklist  but we use a shopping list program for that and sync with my wife s htc m8  may want to try sharing with this app soon  though 
dami    nepal iz   improving there limts     gud  y 
connection issues everytime i try and click on a link or profile i keep getting can not refresh  it does this whether its on wifi   lte  4g so i m finding myself having to continuously close app from multitasking and re load it periodically 
ads problem
often painfully slow  needs a useful tablet ui  quick reply  and the ability to send video  some of these are features the ios version has had for almost 2 years and that isn t really excusable from the company that runs android  this is the kind of thing that makes people switch to ios or makes android phone lovers buy ipads instead of android tablets 
doesn t work every time i try to sign up it says couldn t processes registration  it did the same thing on my android tablet and my doogee x5 cell phone  please fix and i will rate 5 stars
ads way to many ads can t even enjoy the game with the amount of ads i have to watch  every other level there s an ad  that s just ridiculous 
not as good before and rapidly getting worse if used solely for viewing sites without personalization or adjusting the settings this browser has no problems i know of  no benefits either  issues begin to arise  and multiply exponentially  upon applying any changes  if using a text size other than the default a substantial lag reloading begins to occur when scrolling  zooming in  or out  causes large  portions of previously loaded content to go blank  also  in one week this went from the download size of 45mb to over 113mb without my adding any extras 
evernote   forever evernote helps this busy mom with shopping lists  spur of the moment ideas that i want to remember later  a file for different parts of our family life finances  pictures of school fliers  and more  xoxo
well    i just switched to a new htc phone and now chrome forces closed whenever i m reading mostly text websites  it just happend twice in the span of ten minutes and it s getting annoying  i don t even have other apps running in the background or too many tabs open so i don t know what s going on with it
sort option not working they have just provided options for sort  new to older  but it never works
can t work after latest update i keep getting the message that the app has stopped working after last update  phone screen freezes and can t use the phone until i reported the problem  sent feedback   please fix or i will uninstall  on samsung galaxy note  first model 
no longer a casual game the current version of the game makes it too hard to play casually anymore  expect to spend 4 6 hours a day  just to stay afloat 
doesn t work 90  of the time  doesn t update my news feed says cannot connect to internet  the internet on my phone works just fine  i can uninstall and reinstall and it fixes the issue for a few hours then it starts saying cannot connect to internet 
no dark background  in this day and age  an app produced by a company as large as facebook  after moving away from xmpp  thus stopping the use of third party software of the users  choosing  has no option for a dark black background    seriously  get with the times 
almost good enough i have tried lots of android browsers  the reason being that i like speed and simplicity and good bookmark management  that s all i need  i tried firefox  which i use on desktop  as a way of getting away from chrome  because i absolutely hate google and everything and everybody associated with it  seriously  i hate google  unfortunately  chrome is still hands down the best browser i ve used on android  firefox started out fine  but became slower and glitchier as i used it  like everything except chrome  meh
cool app except the notifications freeze  so i have no idea of the upload status  even worse dunno if it even worked or safe to delete those files  becomes more of a broken app to me  another issue i wanted to create a new account for a friends new phone  exclaimed that 2 year 50 gig is available and it shows it is until after you waste time following all of your steps to get 250 mbs or something worthless  keep it honest 
love this app all in one nepalese app    
i used to play this game almost 5 years ago and it was my absolute favorite  i recently re installed it and i got to say  it s very slow and this will be the third time in less than a month that i ve lost my boosters     i have paid for them and it gets taken out of my account but i still don t have them   i really love this game  please fix the app because it s such a great game  get with the program guys  it s just so slow  besides that we love this game 
it s brilliant  take a photo on my phone and within a minute it s on my pc at home  file  same  make a change on a file on my phone and its changed on the file at home   this app makes the above so easy  no issues  crashes or problems      just great 
app continuously losses connection  at times i have to close app and reopen for it to reconnect  every message also takes around 10 seconds to send

best browser for android if you want a browser for android then this is the best browser however to download wallpapers it is not good because it downloads it in bad quality otherwise it is best
perfect  very close to using the desktop client 
chrome since last update you can t scroll down or up   the entire page blinks   blinks  hurts my eyes  ug  it is slower   freezes   too big    to download mp3 of many sites i have to use another browser   they will not download     mrsgwennd
can t open after update the app crashes and doesn t open neither for a second  uninstalled and installed many times   no change  please let me know how to fix it  people write me there and i don t receive nothing

samsung note 4   awesome business platform  please consider adding an edit option in addition to delete for our posts  just in case we d like to correct a mistake  rather than delete the whole thing 
new message notification fault it doesn t notify you of new messages real time  you can only identify new messages if you open the app  therefore  you can not respond to messages real time 
sound decrease issue when i play a video in uc player its 100  sound is equal to my device 60  sound  why sound is decreased in uc mini and shows full volume
enjoying i m unable to delete items from the trash on either samsung phone or tablet   are you able to let me know how or make this available in an update sometime    thanks 
excellent a excellent option if you are looking for a good browser which has speed and is less complicated too and solves most of the search options with built in quick links  good one mait       
i love it i love using uc browser mini because browsing speed of it is marvelous and mind blowing and the size of this app is so small  so overall i would like to say that size of it is small but the work of it is big and awesome 
thanks for this app loved this app but my one suggestion

best app i have seen so far                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           hats off to u guys    
the new app looks great and is very easy to use  however it is missing important features such as endorsing connections or writing recommendations  furthermore i hate the fact that job search is now in a separate app  why do i have to download 2 apps 
please add this option i love using hangouts for both im and sms but when sending a photo from the share menu the app defaults to my sms plan thus costing me money  if i try to go back the hangouts app quits  leaving me with no way to choose of i want to send a picture via mms sms or hangouts  im   its costing me a small fortune  the option to choose how which messaging service you want to use when sharing a photo would be great 
low quality i don t know why but sound is very bad  especially when i talk  i use meizu m2 mini and is not slow phone at all  is there some update or setup whitch can fix it  i will rate 5 stars if there s a fix 
game glitches nice  you have all the cheesy  simple reviews right up first  hey  robin   i was nearly completed the game and i had to uninstall reinstall  losing all my achievements  and it s still freezing up  it even switches to one if those annoying  30 ads in the middle of a game  is there a reason why my game was working just fine until the update 
server error 1 1 cannot login  server error 1 1  all my other application can open  but wechat can t  try uninstall and install again still can t  pls respond  
great game  too much ads angry birds is fun and a great way to kill time  unfortunately it falls short of perfect due to numerous ads littering the game  unless you get ad free  be prepared to get ads up the butt 
are you serious  there is no widget available 
great code but arrogant company linkedin should be proper stewards of the database they have created  and ensure their customers get optimum use  too many gotchas  no cut and paste from messages  closed api s  etc  pretty narrow minded 
forced reload on uploading pic on replying comment last night i tried to reply a comment by uploading a photo from my phone  when i press on the button to select photos the app automatically goes back to the main page  on other occasions  i could enter to my gallery to select my image but as soon as i selected an image and press done  the program  again  forced reload and suddenly go back to the main page  please fix this and i will change my rating  thank you 
still the best mini i like the new look and news front  very fast and efficient  though for overall best all around browsers id go with maxthon  yandex and uc   but for mini s opera mini gold though uc mini is coming along strong     minuses  needs an adblock 
love new material design
its just ok in news paper there alot of time to loaded even in wifi 512kbps
this game      i donno y ppl give it 1 star try it out  n i think if two updates  come wit heros it must be a titan n a character  from naruto  madara uchiha    
great fun  very addictive  still brilliant  loads o  fun  very clever and hugely more ish   and i still love it   
gone crazy after latest updates  it seems to force closed by itself even if i dont use it  always popup a error msg almost everyday  it seems to trigger whenever i switch between mobile data and wifi connection  
this update sucks    i can t open the game anymore  just crashed  damn it  i have an on going war but the app won t run    if there is a half star option to rate this  i would give you that  fix this asap    
very nice app best feature is all friends get in touch with it   runs well during roaming and with low signal   i hope to see some improvement as in group chatting if we have tag feature or topic hashtag feature within the group  so that we can refer to a particular topic in discussion   just like in twitter etc   but within the group not public   would be great 
the fail boat has arrived the 6 0 version is touted as being advanced  but in fact it contains a big old disappointment  the widget  which wasn t even available when google urged us to switch our sms function to hangouts   is now no longer available  wth   fail  why do i want to use an sms app  or any messaging app  which can t even give me a quick review widget on my home screen   pffft   rolled back to 4 2 apk  and using the standalone google messenger app which offers not one but two excellent widgets  one   person specific  
not what i expected i really thought that the new updates will make the app better  but instead it became worst  i m sorry to say that  and i wish if you put this review under consideration  and make the newest update better 
great game i ve enjoyed playing ever since i downloaded it this summer  i like it much more than the first one   the challenges and visuals are improved as well as the way you run through the game  highly recommend 
khtra xa    estae    aap hagu banae rakhnu parxa hau    mitra haru    loved it   
its ok useful app xcept now  viber hasn t been working great sometimes its says disconnected or something although i have a stable internet connection i hope this gets fixed 
needs an actual update  twitter slows down  tweets continue to not even send  it takes a long time to load a tweet and the timeline  i have to use the moblie site version to actually use twitter
