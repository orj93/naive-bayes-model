review
when you repeat over and over that you support animated gifs now  maybe a good idea would be to actually support them 
for the build 13 0 2036 98649  new colour scheme adds nothing to the expirience  but it s the automated smart language update  with no option to select the prefered language that ll be the main reason why i ll uninstall this app 
the app made me i m rating it because of a pop up on the app but i like twitter so i m going to give it 5 stars  the only thing i don t like is the fact that i can t edit posts f ing instagram can but twitter doesn t have option wtf
the worst   this newer version update might look nice  but i stopped getting all push notifications  also  the app doesn t even work most of the time  nothing loads and it keeps telling me to try again  it worked fine before until the most recent update  same as other apps  it just gets worse and worse  don t fix it if it s not broke   
very good one of the best app 
good app it help us to get fast news 
night mode this app is really good actually  but why the night mode doesn t work  what ashame     
support service poor support service 
this new update crashed with my samsung note4 my phone suddenly all black out    shut down  after receiving a wechat message notification after update  my chat backgrounds were all gone blank   i can t find my stickers as well   i have to uninstall the app   but don t know if my chat history will be here or not  
some problems are solved thank you  feeling good more and more  need to play high quality youtube video  its default quality really worst  new bugs can t download video on facebook   thanks for introducing play online on facebook  fix it and if i dont find anymore bug sure 5 star 
beta is the best version of the chrome browsers can t open bookmarks in a new tab or incognito window  can t switch tabs from bookmarks tab  horrible features  the following are issues across all barstools of the chrome browsers  no desktop preferred option  webpages refresh themselves by default and you lose what you are typing of you switch to another app  tabs mixed into os is annoying  no user agent switcher
not bad i like to every news bt i can t get found new update please update hour by hours
viber about the voice messages and chatting  viber is the best app in the market  about the calling services   even messenger performs better  the app isn t optimised for wi fi usage  about the newest version  until 23 12 2015  there is a new option introduced  which allows you to see which of your friends have seen your message in a group chat  well  it is not working and this makes me a little bit mad   finally the function was introduced in viber and still not working properly 
it rocks this thing is  great  i keep documents  photos  everything  accessible on all my devices current  very slick
doesn t allow me to send tab to desktop previously  when i touched the share button  it allowed me to select  firefox  as the share method to send the tab to my synched computer  now the  share to firefox option  doesn t show up  why did it dissapear 
keeps crashing i really do love the browser overall and the ability to install add ons and plug ins is amazing  but it keeps crashing on me all the time  i ll be browsing a page and then all of a sudden the page won t scroll for me  i ll try and zoom in and the font won t rerender  and i can t click on anything  however  the ui still functions normally  but i can t get anything to work on the webpages  if that could somehow be fixed  it d ramp ya back up to 5 stars 
app stops mid call having an issue with viber at the moment on my android  usually great app but stops working a random times     very annoying       have uninstalled and reinstalled 3 times now       may need to find another app 
latest update should be clientside the most recent update added the following features which need to be changed to client side only  colour  nicknames  and emoji  all three change the appearance of the chat stream and are community controlled  these are issues because they change everyone s layout  they need to be controlled by every individual of their own choosing 
groups       edit  i changed my rating from one to three stars due to linkedin s response to my review  glad groups is still in the app but i dont iike that it is not as straightforward to access them as before 
1 major annoyance in the new update show who is online and define what online means   on hangouts  on a google product   using g   can you re add timestamps for each message  please add a dark mode feature as well
unexpected  the new update doesn t let you change your profile pic  and the profile pic can t be seen properly after selecting  fix it 
the best android browser fast  well designed  easy tab management  i was looking for a browser easier to use than google chrome and it s done  great  
edit  wakelock has been fixed  thanks       i used to love this app  but the latest version is holding massive wakelocks and burning through my battery   would be 5 stars without this but essentially unusable now   please fix this battery hog and it will be a 5 star app again 
its getting there  i used to be a chrome opera aficionado but lately they eat too much ram that my phone starts to hang  firefox memory consumption is far less and it s more stable  however  i dislike how websites get blurred when scrolling then slowly clear up like a jpeg being downloaded on a slow connection  i use 4g and bandwidth ain t a problem  i know you can fix it but i ll give you 4 stars for now  thanks for the awesome  browser 
awesome  but less awesome than before this is a really great communications app  better than any other i ve found  but sadly with the last update they took a cool feature away  please bring back the walkie talkie  i know it was silly but you ve no idea how much we used it  it s one of those features that just makes it fun to talk again 
i had over 500 lives and the game wouldn t work so i uninstalled it and reinstalled it and i lost all my men  give them back and i will change my rating  my gold was still there but not my lives  not a happy camper 
great way to stay organized i jot notes for work  family  shopping lists  music   things to do and stories or news feed i want to come back to  great place to store everything 
very poor service now a days for the last one month viber service is detoriated day by day   now the application respond too slow even in 3g network  in wifi the message is always displayed that no network available  please check your internet connection  what happend to developer team  are they sleeping  from google market viber has disappeared suddenly 
5 stars   this app has saved my life on multiple occasions   pictures are life and you help keep mine with me
virus i think your site  s infected  as it is trying to install  some update 
too many useless features does anybody actually use the speed dial cards  why can t i get rid of the discovery button on speed dial  also  the my videos setting is pointless because i have a video player  sometimes  less is more 
the authority firefox is firefox  after wandering here and there you are gonna come back to this standard browser in any platform 
use this with dropsync  dropbox autosync  dropsync works the way dropbox should have  it doesn t have any noticeable battery drain and automatically uploads files faster than dropbox alone 
chrome browser  update  3      barrister akash  it s a fine application i am not only like this application but also i am love thi application  essay browsing   perfectly working   so i have given this application 5 star         akash 
firefox for android  ok  not full firefox  but a good interpretation for small touchscreen devices  firefox sync works well  bookmarks and search history transfer as expected  really helps following up with web searching on the road when i get home to the computer 
where is the option to separate viber contacts  can not see all viber contacts separately  it shows all together after last update  not so good  call drops   while having video call can t hear other person properly     
need more modifications  undoubtly hamro keyboard is one of the phenomenol and must have keyboard app for all nepalese who want to type directly in nepali  however this keyboard s interface or keyboard theme must be improved   wating for new version with improved look theme or interface of keyboard  and finally in my tablet enter key is not working   please fix this   waiting for your response 
all time legendary game the birthday party levels and short fuse levels are fantastic especially when the pigs crash onto different chemicals is just great suggestion to all those players who cringe about too much ads is close ur wi fi connection and then play the game then the ads won t trouble you 
it was good but the last update caused so many forced close  it was good but the last update caused so many forced close  now i can t really enjoy my browsing experience  thanks for nothing
lack of options and closed code so many options for years not implemented and now whatsapp is simply copy pasting the features telegram creates  moved to telegram which is whatsapp but on steroids which even offers desktop integration so you can use it on the pc and more 
google messenger  unite with hangouts   dialer  big problem i have updated to android 6 0 1  ever since update  contacts in mobile contacts do not since  merge  or anything   it acts as a regular text messenger   please fix   i need my google voice  hangouts   dialer fail to work or merge at all 
contacts and delays is it just me  with the new update  all contacts are showing up including those who are not using viber  the old version allows you to hide your contacts who are not using viber  i also that notifications on messages are delayed  pls fix this 
it was okay  but now complete crap why do one now have to change between profiles to see sms or hangouts  before this app but much better where you could always easy select if you wanted to send an sms or hangout   now this app is completely useless 
what is this  google is an oldest browser to search something so when we want to do something on puffin browser then what is the benifit to use it   plz make those things possible wich are possible on puffin especially for android phone   i shall be thankful 
after ur latest update i and my friend made a video call after ur latest update video of my friend z vry clr bt voice cnt b heard of my friend so plz plz resolve dis problem plz plz its a kind request
rashifal ni homepagemai bhaye sun ma sugandha hune 
hate it the new update shifted my tab in lower key    its just sooo irritating  tab looks good on chrome window only   i want tht bk
shite  crashes constantly  test 1st does nothing a browser should  obviously as all basic function is gone no testing was executed prior to release       i do not use youtube or any sites that require more than a browser that loads the page without freezing    bonus   crashing the operating system 
thank you   thank you so much       
still broadcast list didn t improved you should improve back up option    you should give 2 options 1  with media   2 without media only chats   
fix this please    i ve tried editing two of my profile pictures in the past month and each time i do   it doesn t post it  but it also doesn t go away  it fades out the picture and it s always at the top of my time line  now i have one from december 14th  and the second one from tonight at the top of my time line and it won t let me delete them  or do anything about it  and it s really buggin  me  please fix this 
uninstalled i downloaded this app thinking it would soon be supported with google for log in and sync with chrome web version cant or wont do two separate  apps for a to do list       will give 5 star when this is a reality  
man i hate google and android went into my messaging and the default had changed to hangouts instead of sms  stop forcing settings to change when you push through updates  man i m moving to apple as soon as i am able  i hate this phone and your system   
video issues sometimes videos uploaded from places like vine won t load and will play but the screen will show grey  fix please  i don t know if others have this issue  but i am on my samsung s6 and it is doing this 
agree with new ui being too much like fb  also  there is literally no way to modify the app settings  the only option given is to view your linkedin apps  why was this removed  major necessity when you re getting spammed everytime someone posts an update 
slow update  slow  firefox just keeps on getting better with each update   so far it s the only one that supports flash w o force close that i have used on 4 4 kitkat   keep up the great work guys 
didn t work couldn t use it with my note 4  it just gets stuck in the red o and stops
viber rating   lacking code on the android phone  the in call widget is over the top command for all settings alterations on the screen  it is not able to be moved and i can t find the setting to turn it off  might wanna fix it  also it seems not to want to ring on the android phone when you make a call 
ads for some whatever reason sometimes  which is more then you think  would open and show me some security ad  i m not even clicking on chrome and this still happens  plz fix this annoying thing
doesn t login crap doesn t work  only app tat work with todoly is cue 
best browser in short size i cut 1 star because i am facing some issue in downloading two items at the same  1 item s downloading speed is good but another s speed is very slow 
need some improvements hey guys  i personally love this app as it is too easy to type in nepali as it automatically unicodes but you need to add some more features    this app doesn t include capslock  theme customization   it is really hard to type in big screen tablets phones coz it s size relatively small  so please in next update include the features mentoined above    then it will worth                            thanks
edit  gif support  yay  if this can be addressed this app will get 5 stars    having to manually resend messages is a bummer  terrible while traveling with spotty net 
too much going on its cool it works but ony using it because i have to its got way to much going on for a note pad   adds in useless irrelevant information like i made a note on a friends birthday now it says from so and sos birthday but it works great just wish it was just a plain jane note pad like the one htc used this app to replace  if there was a way to over complicate a note pad app they did it it works great like i said and it takes some getting used to and it grows on you  
the new features suck for those of us who don t have a working back button can you guys make the videos able to be slid to the left to exit the video  as i have to force close facebook to exit
the new update sucks i hate that they switched favorite to like   i love twitter so much but it s turning into facebook real fast  i previously rated it 5 stars but right now i m rating it 1 star due to te next update  i ll rate it 5 again once the change is made  until then  if you want a second facebook experience feel free to download 
sucks the new update especially the multiplayer game bonuses sucks    please return to before system    only this time im getting more loots but supercell stop it saying im playing too long without shield then u got my village under attack and loose many of my loots    ur crazy        
won t load everytime i try to use facebook  well lately  it says trouble loading in every aspect  it s been doing this for 2 days i ve tried restarting my phone  closing the app  it doesn t work
seriously needs usability updates  app is ok but storage jumps from free to  10 mo after downloading files dropbox asks to upload it  great  but it asks for the folder every time from the root directory  still  there is no intermediate plan for storage  it goes from free to  10  mo for 1 tb  i don t need 1 tb  but i do need something more than the free plan  google drive will be my new storage since they offer an intermediate plan  i asked for something middle of the road but they aren t interested  i m going to drop dropbox where it belongs  in the trash box   
bookmarking is no good i used to be able to pick where i bookmarked something when i made it  now it saves default to mobile bookmarks folder and i then have to go find the bookmark and edit it to move it where i want it  also when opening bookmarks list it does not open where i was last  it opens up a random list of bookmarks  it was perfectly fine how it was previously  now its just rediculus 
good game but    i have always liked temple run however the new update which included a new map has ruined it for me a little bit   i would of rather of it been snowy on the default map since since for me anyway the new map is a bit confusing and can be harder 
poor customer service the heart button crashes the app whenever i hit it  hasn t been fixed ever since its introduction  within weeks my rate dropped to 1 star  unfortunately
great features  but my notifications don t work title says it all  the app says i should be getting the notifications on my phone but i m not getting any  would rate 5 stars if this was resolved 
update suck its impossible to loot 4m in one day  do u think supercell this is a balance improvement  its not  and the developers dont even care to the comment wtf 
uc hello uc browser i  start uc browser it s open when i type search bar web address it s loading loading it s not showing any thing but if i use vpn its working well  it happen oman lost 2 week so kindly find the solution
great hamro patro
its cool my brother doesnt bug m me anymore i show him angry birds and his mouth shuts but some levels are almost impossible and i have to wait for free power ups or buy them
game ruined because of ads  i felt like re downloading after haven t playing it in awhile  but i was immediately frustrated  a 20 second  awful mobile game ad popped up after the second level  and after looking at the store  i realized that you have to pay to remove ads  yep  uninstalling 
very good i liked the app and it s ui but i think the app can be best if you add option to remind us about any program on radio so that i wouldn t miss my fav programs like timepass        keep developing
good app all is good but sometime its cannot see live but otherwise its great app
what the heck   can t get status updates to be in chronological order   half of my comments don t post   it worked fine before the last update   keeps kicking me out of the app for no reason   won t let me tag people without their name being all jumbled  if i edit a post  it shows the unedited version at the top of my feed  i m 2 seconds away from uninstalling 
awesome can t be productive without evernote   i always find myself searching for new and old notes   great app 
not good i had for a while but is not working keeps messing up my face book must have a big because i deleted and my face book works
still rubbish  still can t log in  fb inspired interface is completely unprofessional  can t log into the app with my password  works on the website  not on the app  takes me back and forth from the login screen to verification and back  the facebook inspired interface is just too unprofessional 
boo  it loads slow even on my hardware  considering kmg is the leading news company   the interface is very poor  i your app is almost like direct links to your websites  and the difference between the low resolution and high resolution files in e paper is not perceivable at all 
cant download big things i cant download 15  mb it says that it failed tell me how it work ur fix it plz
shit guys dont download it  the new update sucks  there is noo looot base after update  especially new ones who download it will affect seriously  the true color of supercell is revealed  they want to buy gems  because we don t get loot
better user interface  worse quality the user interface is definitely better now but at the same time there is a bug concerning synchronising the contacts with the phone contacts  and even when that bug got fixed the contact photo doesn t get shown any more in contrary to previous releases   
the app won t load since this update the app doesn t even load  it just stuck on downloading content and then restart  try to uninstall and re install it but it s going the same error all the way  please fix this    
slick chat app  reactions are my favorite part of using slack  i love adding my own 
connection issues with the version it says can t connect to server    with error report 1  1  everytime either connected with cellular data connection or over wifi
all in one app dis version of uc browser mini disappointed me as search showing in notification bar  and when v download anything was not visble in notification bar as previous version  its request to look into it and try to solve it otherwise as i have to uninstall it and goto some other app 
it was epic    then a certain update happened the most recent update got rid of what a ton of people loved  i think supercell has some work to do if they think i am gonna be buying any more gems 
better than groupme     
awesome browser really easy to use  and more importantly allows you to install ad block extension  to get rid off annoying ads  love it
great internal comms system for our business
it s been 1 or 2 months and yall still havent fix the this recent december 2015 update has made the gameplay so lopsided that i can not compete with anyone l attack   there is now no reason for me to invest anymore time in coc   can no longer protect my loot and no shield
very reliable syncing but      the web ui looks like it s been designed by a college kid with a laptop no grid view 2gb free space in 2016 wah photos look ridiculous on  list view the android app does nothing but getting bigger and bigger with each update without adding up any noticeable feature too plain and oversimplified ui no download option directly to sd card 
was great i was going to give this 5 stars until the latest update causes it to constantly crash and force close  please fix it  i love playing this game 
no auto upload for photos what worked super on my s4 does not work on nexus 6p  i have to open the app for photos to back up  sad  very sad 
really  i honestly ussd to love this app     now i realize it s honestly terrible  i still use it every so often but for sms  i suppose theres bulk in the programming but i can have 4g lte and be told i have no signal to send a text  you re better than this google 
fix or i quit don t download this game the new update sucks and is just a money grab for the developers  the game won t load half the time and it kicks you off before you can even play  not to mention the new rules are made to make you buy gems rather than raid for supplies  i have used a lot of money over the years yes years to have you all of a sudden change the rules on farming and game play  fix these issues or i m done but from what i see in the other comments i don t think the developers even care 
2 big issues 1   there is no download manager in chrome   when i select save target as   i don t have any control over the download   i can t pause or cancel it after that and most of the times i am unable to download the file          2   i can t use two chrome tabs in multi window on note 3   i can do that in note 5 but it just doesn t work in note 3   plz fix
rewelacja bardzo u  yteczne narz  dzie do komunikacji w zespole 
annoying in app purchases a great product but constant popups encouraging you to upgrade ruin the experience
great app   good tool for my arsenal  it s like a virtual notebook or binder or file cabinet for me  and its wonderful   i use different apps for quick notes and tasks  i would use it for tasks if it had repeating reminders   ability to snooze them  then also sync w google calendar   but if i need to save long term notes  or receipts  or travel plans  prayers   spiritual writings  how tos  etc   evernote is the app for that   easy to use  never loses my notes  it is dependable and reliable   i love using the desktop version also 
i get all these requests on fb but yet i go on candy crush and nothing getting very tired of it  then using the special candys they dont even do anything anymore what use to clear all rows no clears 3  no wonder no one plays this anymore
love it but there should be switch off or sign out button having a sign out option helps you maintaining your personal space  you can keep a check on the constant addiction and usage of this service and it can help you in striking a balance between your personal and social life 
thank you very much for sticky notification 
it s great when it works but right now it won t download any mms  it just says they re there and won t download them  and then loses the message when i switch to a different app to try to download it instead 
bug in changing notification sound i gave 1 so developers may look at it now  this bug is here since long time as i checked in internet  please take a look at it and send a reply or update   handset   note 5   hope to see the update and change my rating to 5 again 
keeps losing connection ever since the update messenger has been losing connection and i don t get how if i m connected to wifi and it s just been doing that ever since  and also i thought the chat bubble allows you to open the chat while on another application  well now ever since the recent update every time i open the chat bubble it exits me out the application i m on  i don t know if it s a bug or something but please fix it 
addictive   the only negative is that you re never given gold bars   you have to buy them 
i can t see my h u d  on my screen anymore ever since the new update my screen doesn t show up the images it used to now all i see are words floating in thin air with no back ground to it       not sure how to get help with this or  to unis tall and re install     
following back it doesn t let me follow people that have followed me back   and also the amount of people following and followers is also incorrect     overall it is a live appp
memory game the levels are so hard and less moves   l do no how to pass 95 levels but levels are so bour  chico bar is very hard to finish  please any of you send me life
unable to send message or update this new version does not allows sending messages nor does it updates the status  it keeps suggesting to come back  linkedin what happened  your app was one of the best 
the scoring system on facebook gains more points than mobile on jelly levels and i think that needs to be changed  e g   using a colour bomb with jellies on candies gives much more points on fb  than mobile  also there are no fish once  u finish jelly levels  please change the scoring system so it is the same for both platforms and that there is no bias against mobile 
best cloud provider love the flexibility  feature set  and streamlined setup  use it daily

        best         hamro nepali keyboard is doubtlessly  the best keyboard for fluent nepali typing on android mobiles and tablets  it has given  oppurtunity to thousands of nepalese people for sharing their thoughts  expressing their feelings and chatting up with buddies through  common and national language i e  nepali  thumbs up for creating this amazing app    wish you d also add some theme customization options and improved caps lock option 
please do not stop carousel   google has improved their gallery app  google photo  to make google drive better for photo backup  cannot only store photos  but also create interesting effects  animations and story for users  and even  unlimited space  however  meanwhile  you decided to give up carousel  i am a royal user of dropbox  but don t you know that photo backup is one of the most important things while one chooses an online storage tool  wish this will not be the turning point that dropbox is beaten by google drive 
fail to launch i can sign i online via a pc but the app gets me nowhere  it downloaded fine but now that it is on my phone i am in a never ending sign in loop where i get their blurb  press the button to login  enter u n   pw but then it takes me right back to the app s burn  frustrating to say the least after i was so looking forward to making use of this app after having downloading it on chrome 
works fine for the most part  not sure why it decides to sometimes notify me and sometimes not  i guess it has something to do with inactivity on other logged in devices  i m usually logged in 24 7 on 2 computers and a phone  
it is best app for regular news update  but    please add more news updates in nepali language too 
whenever i post an update and then try to edit it when i hit save it tells me the post is no longer available and may have been removed yet the original post is still on my page   please fix issue

love hate has bug and security issues  i tried to report that facebook and google plus have security issues and it wouldn t allow me to do so  well i just did didn t i        
candy crush  i have been  having trouble playing on candy crush so in the end i uninstalled it   i then re installed and signed back in  in doing this i m back to my level but lost all my boosters 
simple fun game this is the type of game that can be easy and difficult at the same time  each game is determined by how the candies drop  so sometimes you can fly through a level and other times you can be stuck for days  a good time filler when you have 5 mins to spare 
excellent this app is great  keep up the good work guys  
ever so useful evernote it is so easy to  scribble  something down when you have your smart phone  tablet  laptop  or whatever   you can be spontaneous  yet accurate because you write when you are at the place and at the time   when you return to your main computer your writing is there waiting for you   almost magical   such a time saver and a memory keeper 
notifications not working i don t get notify about anything  new followers  retweet  likes  non of that and yes i ve enabled all the notifications in the settings but nothing happened   
big problem new update showing all contact and there is no setting for this prob do sum thing fastly
simply good but    i think loss of reply option keeps people away from this app because  especially  in the groups  it s necessary to show whom your chatting with   
doesn t log in checked my credentials multiple times  will not authenticate 
nice browser but   there is no doubt that firefox is one of the best browsers out there be it pc or mobile  great options to customize the browser to suit your needs  however this still continues to be my secondary browser as cm browser is still way to fast even when loading heavy websites  i hope the speed improves in newer versions and i ll add a 5 star rating 
dont download not enough trump memes too much netflix and chill  stop already please   if you are looking for dumb girls that tweet everything that goes through their heads then this app is for you   blessup
meh    hope it supports dual sim when used as default sms manager  and hangouts running very slow when opening a conversation

account in private it just keep on saying that my account is in private   and needs to verify   but when i do   it keeps on asking my cp number   when i already filled the gven information  it keeps mentioning about security   i just dont know how to deal with it   can you tell me how  
would give 5  if i could retrieve my previous game my phone crashed and i had to install it again  didn t get to keep my score  coins and boosts  the gems i paid for where also lost  negatives aside  i enjoy this game  its a good time waster  i thinks it s better than the first temple run 
won t make calls i have 5 bars on verizon 4g but it keeps saying can not connect call   so far had only connected 1 call when i had 1 bar and the other person couldn t hear me  i have tried at over 20 different locations in the city i live in all around 4 or 5 bars   no calls can be made   fix this 
came here to rate this app to give 5 stars for good optimization for android this is one of the only apps that i open and close and it actually clears fully from ram and does not use up cpu power  unlike facebook and its messenger using up ram and cpu 
doesn t send the message i have an active internet connection  but the message can t be sent  connection problem  etc
simple and powerfull  it s fast  small and perfectly designed for phone with low ram like my htc one  if your official facebook application always crashes and takes a lot of space on your phone  i highly recommend you this browser  the facebook feature is amazing  it s very fast and notifications pop ups  even when the browser is close  i love it 
idk i can t edit my posts  things such as my profile picture  when i edit it  it becomes grey and says that it is no longer available  please fix  i have an htc desire  will rate 5 stars shown fixed     
definitely worth your time  there are too many lousy whiners reviewing this amazing app  if you re not happy  take a long hike douchebags  
the new updates are cool but     whenever i try to favourite a tweet now  it closes the app saying unfortunately  twitter has stopped  maybe it s just my android idk
doesn t work whatsapp messages weren t sending at all  it wasn t a connection problem  i checked  so i tried reinstalling and it won t even let me set up my account now    they ask for my phone number and it keeps trying to connect and fails  again  not a connection problem  what do i do    
epaper not upto date epaper not updated for day    what is wrong with this app    
bookmark folders what happened to the bookmark folders  everything was organized like it was on my computer and now they are just on a list  kind of hard to find things when they are like that
it s ok     only 1 request    its been now more than 1 2 yrs for whts app but desperately waiting for feature which shows active or live whts app users from contacts  if whatsapp add this feature  then 101  sure whatsapp will rock                      
love it        i love angry birds  i can sit and play on for hours upon end  love the challenges they threw at me
you should fix this it does nt work anymore  i don t know what to do  because everytime i open this app  it automatically closes and a pop up message says  unfortunately  facebook has stopped 
i found this app very fruitful   and m using it but can you please tell me how to write                         
used to be good everything was great  until i updated this most recent version  now  i m on facebook on my cell  it kicks me off  repeatedly  i try and like something  it takes several times tapping the screen before it even lets me    if i don t get kicked off   please fix this  
notification problem though i have enabled notification  there is no any notification of news  plz fix it
whatsapp   free if you want an app that is basically the same and is free forever  get line  free calls   messaging    i personally like line more because you are able to get different stickers images to send in the chat 
lucky money i have some money sent to me and i want to give to my chinese friends as token of luck but don t see lucky money or wallet anywhere     i have english wechat 
1 star new update i am a busy man and don t always have hours to play games  coc let me pick when i had time to play  after the update that is no longer true  now i have to get on every few hours and raid for hours and hours just to level 1 building  they made the game for the 1  hardcore players  not the average player 
ads  really  ads in the kantipur app  you guys so down to earn money 
annoying sometimes why does opera need to reload the pages i ve opened for later viewing  i have a decent phone with a lot of ram the old opera could do this just fine so why can t the new one   my other problem occurs when reading text that requires zooming in and panning    when scrolling down the address bar disappears  great  that s fine  but when i pan left right  it appears again   jolting my text up and down making me loose my place  highly annoying  still happens when i toggle full screen  
useful app very useful app in my opinion  note taking is great with voice recognition  being able to add pics brings a nice presentation aspect when sharing with a group  the functionality just needs to keep improving for the average person to be perfect 
not letting me log in  i try to log into my account with my user id and it says it needs to be verified by sending a code to my phone but it never does  i even press resend mutiple times  can you please help me 
puro malware viva telegram  nose como han hecho que con la nueva funci  n de marshmallow de compartir que te salgan contactos directamente  solo te salga whatsapp  siempre uso telegram y han conseguido que nunca me salga esta funci  n con telegram y solo con whatsapp  desinstalando ya

malayalam font overlapping malayalam fonts are overlapping in facebook at speedmode  also automatically turn on facebook notification  if i  turned off  please fix it 
really useful app                   
has potential could be better but it conts to crash after some use  love the web version though 
i want the old theme back      this theme is awful  previously opera mini was the best browser but now i think it s worst  no  i don t want to see the news or anything  just return the old opera mini back  you just make it awesome to awful 
refuses to clear history on exit and submitting reports does nothing since i have been reporting this for the last few months  for those of you complaining about crashes  that is probably because you do not have enough internal memory to run firefox properly 
bugs  bugs  and more bugs with each update  if you re unable to improve something which was already good  then don t      it up  google talk    notifications bugs are all over the place  edit  application must be reloaded ultimately to be able to view messages   edit  now crashes all day long and requires phone reboot each time 
fb notification turns on automatically even after disabling it and tamil language is not quite clear      
good thank you for your previous reply  but i think you guys got me wrong  my friends are not able to endorse my skills and not the opposite  i dont know how to enable the endorsement 
excellent reception amazing app that lets you keep in touch with family and friends without the worry of expensive mobile bills 
unbelievably bad support by google for their own products   had to hard reset my android 4 04 tablet and could not reinstall chrome because google no longer supports chrome browser on android 4 0x   so i had to install a non google browser  i would give a rating of 0 if i could

is a shame that when you share picture with your contact all people that has google account sees all the pictures and those pictures supposed to be a private picture that was shared between contact               
pretty good if i do say so myself oh wait i did  it s a very fun game to play
not happy with this app not one of my life or ticket requests come through    i get notified on fb that people have sent them  then when i open the app there is nothing there   having to pay to get to the next level really sux

apps error recently     my phone when wanted to post picture    the sorting is not from the newest    but showing the oldest and need scroll down until the end
useful and well designed  however glitchy the app is really well designed  however  i ve begun to notice that if you end a call while it was on mute or if the call loses reception because of wifi issues on either person s end  the app does not record how long the conversation lasted  in fact  it doesn t show that a call even took place 
lost power ups switched phones and lost my power ups  i had accumulated quite a lot  how do i get them back

this update completely destroyed my facebook  it loads to the status screen but once i try click anything at all or scroll the app goes to my home screen  it doesn t even say force close  it just does it so i load it again and finally begin scrolling but not even 5 scrolls later the app closes     this never happened before i updated fb  
why theres a delay on the messages  u will know u have messages when u open the app  it doesnt notify u even if ur connected to internet  wtf
google messenger and hangouts should become one google messenger and hangouts should become one app that works like imessages except android  if it detects they are using hangouts google messenger it will send a message in the form of hangouts  which will show up in the conjoined app  but if it doesn t detect them using hangouts google messenger then it will simply send a sms message instead
too many recent glitches i used to play this all the time  i m level 500  but now can t even log into the game  it started removing received boosters n not recording passed levels so they d have to b replayed  now it tries to load for 5 8 mins then just kicks me off  haven t been able to play for weeks now  will b uninstalling soon if not fixed  really disappointed with candy crush now 
so unstable after daily updates had it 4 stars for a long time  this week there were daily updates and the latest one didn t fix my problem  i get a pure white screen upon launch  that would be fine if this was a  flashlight app  i uninstalled and reinstalled  still a flashlight 
booster should be internet independent why internet connection required to get daily spin  it should be  part of game itself  every time i have open net connection to get daily spin  unacceptable 
good its very good to use     but i found some fualts    while writing lengthy status  the words which we enter at starting will not be visible  so to edit those words we should slide through the text we have written    so make status editing line step by step instead a single line 
works but very basic  needs more  works fine  needs interface update  how about thumbnail icon views  or a small list  for instance  photos need a timeline  or even a  gasp  metadata exif tag search  how about embedding carousel functionality  and adding to it  google photos is far from perfect  but does have good ideas 
only two stars because frozen shadow is not compatible to my device      why oh why        make it compatible please  
awesomness this game is awesome but tricky with ice i play all day trying to win i might say i m good at this game but my friends and family ily look over my shoilder and say your playing the game wrong but i love this game
new user  great app  have suggestions so far  i love working with the app on all devices  desktop  web    android phone   it integrates very well with other related apps  however  i would give 5 stars if developers could do 2 things  1  allow check boxes bullet items to be easily re ordered  drag drop  it s kind of a big deal for me and 2  allow duplication of notes  if these functions already exist  then hopefully someone will share how to do it  or i ll figure it out soon enough  and then i ll gladly rate 5 stars  great job guys 
best nepali typing apps 1 you can type any nepali text in eng and it will show suggestion of nepali words  2 you can copy it in sd card and transfer to your pc also and many more you will only know after installing it  
app requires frequent login password why the hell this app everytime requires password to open   this is not expected from proffesional app like this   who the hell remembers password for each and every app or site 
constantly erases text i have frequently lost messages i ve been typing  sometimes very long ones  when the screen changes orientation  if i tip my screen even a little and messenger shift the orientation it instantly erases everything i ve written 
a lil  more features to be included there should be a option so as to u the profile pic is not visible to everyone   because if you block people then they can t even send you msges   and also more no  of people in a group  maximum should be 500 
superb  all in one 
good this is a great game  good challenges too  something you can just easily wip out when you are bored  keep on coming with more great games rovio entertainment
better background playback and  new tab  position firefox is the best looking browser on android if i do say so myself  what i hope for are video sounds playing smoothly when the app runs in the background  since i use youtube as ambience a lot  and the  new tab  button being on top of the menu like the other browsers to make navigation easier 
loved it i loooooooooooooovvved it because it is incredible  awesome  and it s in go power and make a new clash of clans the same thing  butt better
it was  working great   before  the bugs   worse   with the bugd  and without

z2 put direct exit button  when use back button its very difficult to exit from some sites like bank or other password protected sites  i m going to disable crome from my fhone  i cant directly exit from crome  i have to use back back till all tabs not closed
very useful thank you android for introducing me to drop box   extremely useful  whether on android  computer or both    now i can sync my personal files and doucments on all my devices and i can still securely access them online from any browser  not to forget to mention about the sharing options     great app  
neat nice  smooth  speed but downloading is lacking in speed correct this i ll give u 5 star
trust worthy as always  have been a long time user of firefox in all my desktops and laptops  now using it on my android phones as well  not settling for any other second rate browser  
hamro keyboard it is fantastic app for mobile and to write in nepali or hindi  i use this app becoz type in english as nepali lipi it will change automatic in neali  eg  haami nepali hau it ll change into                                           tq

just one irritating issue very nice app    except one issue      there is no option of select all for photos inside a folder  i have to select each photo individually  and there is no option to download or make offline the entire folder  one of the above options must be there 
i love dropbox   but   i wish that the interface didn t look so cheap  it s the only thing that s letting down a potentially stunning app  make it look as great as it s functionality and i ll happily give it five stars  no qualms 
fastest browser it s fast  it s reliable  the only problem i have with it  it don t like to download video s or game s  so both video s   game s it goes to the site just no downloads come up   also the lil emoji s that have action to them  it don t show their lil action  i would give a 5 star rating but until then a 3 star is all  i hate that to cause this really is a fast browser  maybe the fastest  so please fix those bugs 
best browser but keeps crashing i ve no clue but my browser keeps on crashing for unknown reason  even while browsing on simplest of websites  this is after the previous update  updating again hopefully it goes away
voice messages problem most times recorded message don t be delivered completely    it is always missing a big part of it  i noticed that this happens when ever the cellular network is unstable    how ever it is a big disadvantage of the app   hope you fix it so so i can give the app 5
issue in last online time it doesn t refresh the last online time automatically    i have to restart my phone then it shows the latest online time    please fix it guys    otherwise a gud app
did not work i looked for a movie and the app said it was no such thing as i looked up big mommas house 2
rubbish the amount of memory it gives for free is rubbish it s very little compared to one drive they also need to fix the drop box when you upload or dowload large files it doesn t do it straight away generally expensive to get more memory    need to give more free memory without crazy price tiers    never will i use drop box again    people out there check other clouds e g  one drive  gmail drive  just other drives    very dissapointed with dropbox 
frozen world   changed stats i love this game  now with the frozen verison up and running  finally got to a high score of 8 736 101 with no save me and my stats had  not changed  when get past 12 million  screen starts going slow and skipping along as if still downloading while running through the forest  please fix  not cool   
twitter is great to connect with my classmates  as i m on exchange at the moment  however  i cannot view who s liked my posts  it will say there s 9 likes  but will only show me 3  also  the notifications aren t very good  sometimes it won t tell me if someone has followed me or if they ve liked retweeted one of my posts 
awsome great  type of social media nothing wrong with it it used to crash on my phone but since the update its doesnt even lag a bit pleaz get
update sucks    it has become so slow now that no page opens even on 3g  trying to make the user interface like chrome is a ridiculous idea  as everyone is saying the facebook page doesnt open n it even logged out  please roll back your stupid update 
the ads ruin my fav app i mean the ads for viber desktop  i dial my friend  start talking and what happens next is  my microphone turns off  speakers turn on and the browser starts launching  so my friend is saying something for everyone to hear because she cant hear me and i am pushing buttons like crazy trying to stop browser from launching  it does take a while on my phone  what happens every time is that viber desktop ad launches about 3s after i make a call  thats the right way to stop me using the smartphone app 
viber i think so she s going to you guys you know figure out free for the rings sometimes i forget to ring in all forget to the shop  the message of this one now i ll let you know no i hope you figure out later so that s my paper right

two stars it used to work really well and the colors and nicknames and emojis are really cool and the snow and the hearts when sending some emojis are really cool  but the last update really s   s  can t use any other app when using the chat heads  youtube stops when using the chat heads  the message sending is slow  sometimes it doesn t even feel that i m connected to the internet and sometimes can t even send the messages  please fix it as soon as possible

the most useful app in the marketplace if used properly       if you ve ever thought how nice it would be to get rid of all the paper and clutter in your life and yet still have it available anytime all the time using powerful searches  then evernote is for you  take a picture of anything and store it  scan paper using your smart phone or scanner and store it all in a note  forward emails directly into evernote  drag and drop computer files  create a note using your finger in handwriting or text mode  clip pages or parts of web pages  use voice      
good    chrome is improving     but there are some problems    1 we can t change the default download location    2 app size is high    3 can t save web pages for offline viewing     4 can t stop loading web pages easily

ads  ads and more ads i don t mind having ads but when it s a 30 second long commercial between each game it becomes annoying to me  i deleted this  i don t remember that many ads last time i played this  if you can handle ads all the time it s a fun game to play but no longer for me 
issues setting up  works fine now had issues with registering verification email initially  eventually did it via the browser than the app  the app works fine now once set up  do like it 
it was a great game   until the last update   and cost of upgrade for th10 has always been beyond the reach of the average players   and let s not start about the time to wait for the upgrades to finish    seems like supercell only cares about wants high level trophy pushers   and they don t want people who don t can t buy gems to even to touch this game or maybe even like it
excellent as long as you have good service  it works great  use it to talk to my family in chile and asia   it cuts out if you don t have wifi or excellent service 
i love viber viber is an excellent chatting software  only one tiny negative comment for you  sometimes it takes a delay to reach message even online   stickers are so cool   
always entertaining we all know angry birds by now  definitely an enjoyable and entertaining game to help you kill time  the only thing that i don t like about it are the advertisements when i m playing with my wifi of data turned on  they can be a bit disruptive during game play
again and again    what happened to you guys     you are not listening us     again there is problem in downloading large files    and the download speed is furthermore decreased    even the phone is connected with wifi    pls fix this      3 stars for browsing speed only
developers please read  i think there needs to be some kind of confirmation implemented when the  buy extra moves for 9 gold bars  button is clicked  i recently didn t do so well on a level and i ran out of moves  when going to press  end game    i  pressed the extra moves by accident and it took 9 bars even though i had no intention of continuing  i felt hurt after saving them up for so long  please consider this 
doesn t work won t allow you to log in 
mark i found viber to be extremely efficient way to communicate with my loved one  i have skype as well but it s not as good as viber

would rate 5 but since the new update every time i try to play the new world get kicked out of game
good

freaking awesome                                                        it has no real story line but it doesn t matter this was the first video game i ever played so i obviously love it it s almost better than super mario brother for crying out loud the characters are great the pig s are cute and it has my favorite bird in it hall  or green bird not gonna get in to the details of why i love hall but mea  also the pigs forts are awesome  so that s why i rated angry birds five out of five game of the year
wonderful for project coordination this is a great tool to have when coordinating projects  it keeps everyone on the same page and in communication 
now perfect  with animated gif support
fun works perfectly well  ads aren t as annoying as you think  especially for a free game 
superfast  just as i remember it   opera mini was the  1 browser back in the days of symbian  glad to see it still up there  superfast  smooth  minimal data used  as opposed to chrome which is starting to stutter   lag  even on simple pages with a few commercials 
awesome voice quality the best in class audio  plz include group voice calls  only video calls have it  option to add another person between the call should be provided 
what the hell   stole all my boosters  all my boosters and power ups are gone   return it now   had more than 60 of each  what a cheap manner to manage the game   return all power ups nowww    
decembers update this recent december 2015 update has made the gameplay so lopsided that i can not compete with anyone i attack  there is now no reason for me to invest anymore time in coc  can no longer protect my loot and no shield
i do not want to search for new connections every time i open the app  no means no  just live with it and keep the experience smooth 
stay on your toes with a new issue every month every time i solve an issue with this app  a new one seems to crop up  recently i stopped receiving sms from my husband who uses google voice  went through the troubleshooter which directed me to make sure his messages aren t ending up in the spam folder  well  that s only accessible from the desktop app  you can t even view spam messages from the android app  or the mobile website  gtfohwtbs 
funny this game is nearly perfect except for ads and then you look at the sequel and think wow rovio messed up our beloved birds used to be such a great franchise
new update killed the game new matching for atks basically killed the farming part of the game so you no longer can aquire resources for upgrades  get your money ready because buying your resources will be the only way 
i love playing candy crush but    why when u go to another episode  you have to wait for along time for example i was in level 50 and i passed it and had to wait 75 hours for episode 3 the game is good and very addictive but i don t like the waiting for the episodes      by the way good     work
does what it says i love this site for my computer and wish it had a more mobile friendly interface  this app does what it says it does  i just find it so unorganized and a little bit stressful to use  good start  room for improvement 
not since the update i don t                                   update   it is very slow on both data  uk ee network  and wifi  all of home via bt  work network london underground virgin network  on all devices  version number is 13 0 2036 98649 on each device   practically unusable at present and everything was fine before upgrading   reading other comments i m far from the only one having problems  high and low quality images helps but it is still worse than before the upgrade   and just discovered that previously a double tap enlarged the text sufficiently to make it readable   now it enlarges it a tiny amount but pinch and zoom is still required     why did you do this   the good old adage  if it ain t broke don t fix it absolutely comes to mind 
ugh i don t recommend this because when i tried getting into the game it says that it s downloading but it really isn t and then it doesn t work and i cant play it   i was so excited to play the game but it just doesn t work for me  
glitch  not working on galaxy note 5 this is my third time downloading on my note 5  which is less than 1 week old  worked perfectly on the note 4  what happens is that at first  right after install  it works good  then  i am not able to touch the top lefthand icon which gets me to all my channel options  so  i m installing again 
unable to work with google   yahoo id sso notice that it still can t work with google   yahoo sso which is a big feature missing   it is a good initiative  but still some work to be done before the star     still thanks for the effort 
google chrome app it allows me to browse the internet on a phone of all things  seriously guys we re living in the future  5 stars because it always works 
i wish there is a mute button for selected people  i like it so far but it is more like a skype now  but i hope next update the will be option like mute button where i can mute someone so that i won t recieve any notification from that particular person without deleting the message or blocking them coz that would be so rude if i do that  or option where i can hide the seen or a mark as unread  other than that it is good i liked it  that s all my concern 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         i love hamro keybord
doesn t work challenge page fails to load  it s so secure even i can t get in 
     u can not send vids on some android devices u can on some apple devices but they have to be under 16 seconds and u have to make them u can t use short vids from your album camera roll but video calling is good u also can t have a icon for a group chat      everything else is good except sometimes it takes 10 minutes to send one text  
it s useful a great app and pretty much an essential part of my organization  a minor complaint is that the desktop program doesn t look as appealing as the mobile app  and that the mobile version is lacking some useful functions  e g  the ability to delete tags  or to strikethrough text  
so much room for improvement    the twitter app has been around for several years and yet it still hasn t lived up to its full potential  here s an example  how don t we have the capability to save gifs and videos  not only that  but it d be cool if we can customize and have different layouts and appearances  simple updates like those would make this app so much better  not lame ones like changing favorites to likes  hopefully these ideas can be considered for 2016 
does exactly what it states  thank you 
temple run  pretty good the game is fun but i would like it if it didn t have so many videos for one specific app most of the time  it would also be nice if you could choose to be a boy or a girl character  overall the game is okay pretty good
candy crush i rated it a 2 star because when i send out ticket request i never get them  i know for a fact that 6 people sent me tickets back and i only got 1
classic browsing at it s best    i ve recently upgraded to android from a bb9900  i ve been using opera on my bb for years  was actually disappointed with android at first  until i installed mini   webpages like facebook are back to the way they should be  please don t change a thing  using mini for facebook is the best  where can i donate 
bug whenever i search anything it opens google i know i want to open google    but after searching something for sometime it again opens new google nd slows down the scrolling     please fix this    
    when will this app be created to automatically start at the top with new posts instead of having to scroll through days of old tweets to get to the top  the only social app that does that  such a headache 
i loved it i used so many times so its more attractive me bt every things r good if improve some more typeing system to essy type here is i got for typeing problem so 
pretty good the people who don t like the power ups can just turn them off in the first part of the game      i also like the red s mighty feathers 
it was good untill i upgrade overall opera mini is good  the page loads faster and saves time  but most of the time eventhough i have a good network connection  it will show that there is no network connection  then   when i upgrade to this version   the network speed after this update is really so fast    when i tried to download a song   eventhough i have 3g connection it downloads at a rate of 4 7 kb sec   it took 20 mins to download a 6mb song in a 3g connection  i am really frustrated with this    so i am going to uninstall it 
force close it s been 1 or 2 months and y all still haven t fix the error  i can t play  it s always crash and force to close everytime i m online for 10 seconds 
i met my life here  my girlfriend heads off the app   thank you wechat    the entire team  
bait and switch i purchased my 3rd samsung tablet with  advertisement of free gifts  one of them being 48 additional gb cloud storage for 2 years   the 2nd samsung tablet i bought also had this free gift and it was a nightmare to get samsung and dropbox to honor it   so  after buying this 3rd high end tablet with the same claim of the free 48gb for 2 years in the fine print  which you can only see after purchasing the tablet  dropbox only honors the offer on the first device you purchased and you are disqualified for all future devices   this is sleazy and bait and switch   free  not subject to any compensation  encumbrance  repayment in kind  etc   because of this bait and switch advertising on the part of samsung and dropbox i suggest you really find out what kind of company dropbox is before using their services 
notification problems hangouts doesn t keep up with push notifications  to update messages i have to go into the app and manually update  been having this issue on and off for months 
somethings missing is there a possibility to have your troops have the  winter  theme  like having the wizards red cloaks or max lvl balloons with red colored balloon and pekka that is literally a sword wielding snowman  its worth it  to add those features rather than just making it snow while covering some buildings with snow 
kill pages i will enter a url or open a new link and nothing loads  no loading bar  no error page   the page stays the same  also if i switch to a new tab  sometimes that won t load refresh  or if i switch back to an old tab the same thing happens 
having a headache because of this enough with the limits on this app  okay  i was trying to get rid of some tweets on my account and it s telling me  cannot retweet status  or when i try and tweet something   failed to send tweet   like  seriously 
this is it  so  this is gonna be the list of things you need to improve for constant five stars   include more emojis   the ones you provided don t even express enough feelings of a dog    provide instructions somewhere because people have uninstalled this app because they were more confused than they were thankful to you guys   when i capitalize english letterd  only one letter is capitalized and it goes back to lowercase  fix this   you guys are awesome i love this app   no more bugs keep up the great work   
too much pop up add
amazing upgrade  love the upgrade in the game  just when i thought this game couldn t get any better  it exceeds my expectations  good job guys 
can t change my color like every one els my friend updated his when i did mine we have the same phone he got to change colors an mine stayed the same ether fix or i m not using this crap app any more
great app minus the spam  best note taking app  honestly  this app does everything you could possibly need it to  keywords make searching for notes so easy   however    please stop pushing me so hard into paying for premium plans  i do not need nor do i want them  obviously if i m dismissing the ad every time i use the app i must not be interested  stop spamming me  edit  why are you still spamming me  please please stop  no does not mean keep asking   
so far nice and useful but    please  introduce option for choosing who and in which group someone can add you  hate when people put you in group with bunch of strangers sharing some irelative stuff without my approval or knowledge  otherwise  app rocking 
bad bad google why was i sent to password recovery options when updating a browser app    5 stars   is it time to go to an apple or windows phone platform america 
so disappointed my candy crush would not connect to fb so i uninstalled and reinstalled  still didn t work so i restarted my phone  that worked only i m two levels back and all my power ups are gone        
classic game ruined by ads  uninstalled this o one classic game utterly unplayable due to excessive ads  installed the other day for my 5 year old to keep him quiet  wondered why he kept crying and complaining  realised he was constantly being bombarded with adds that took him out of the game after almost every level  ridiculous 
bad app for a great site linkedin is great but the app sucks  i always have problems opening the app  most of the times it asks me to retry or try later because the feed never loads  there are a bunch of other bugs 
fun diversion good game to take a quick break from whatever you re doing  nice test of your ability to see and hear what s coming ahead and react  the latest update with the winter map improves the core game quite a bit 
lifesaver this app is the one i use to keep track of my christmas shopping  my 2015 christmas notebook has separate notes for each person  i can check the 2014 notes to make sure i don t duplicate   but i use it all year around for med lists for my mom  grocery lists   pictures i need   it s a lifesaver for my overworked memory 
not working at all after updating  hangs phone nd freezes entirely    it takes too much time to open sometime    please resolve this as soon as possible
its nice     accecesible where mobile mobie data is or wi fi if accesible so that if are are in in trouble of any sor anyttime we can immediatetely tweet which reaches to near n dear ones   other thousands of ther too on the web         helpful in many ways

worst app ever seen  one of the worst app i have ever seen  it takes more then 2 minutes to open   my htc m8 frequently gets lag while running this app  app developer  just look times of india app   try to improve your kmg app 2  for now  i suggest everyone  don t
no upgrades to the game till yet   the developers have no idea how to do upgrades     most of the people have stopped playing it because it got old and there is no fun playing it now   
really love the new game  but since this update the game keeps shutting down on my s5  please fix the glitch
unfollow tool does not function unfollow controls do not work on my tablet for friends  i have to go to a pc based messenger to adjust this feature
the best game about they dont call this the no 1 app for nothing  its the original and best clean game about  one needs to work out how best to strike the piggy structures by flinging the birds in a sling  funny though  i thought they had wings   it is a wonderful novel idea for a game and will no doubt will continue to appeal to a wide audience for some time to come   it s as big as what the old lemmings game was in the 1990s  it s so addictive and fun to play whilst having a good feel about it  for me beats angry birds 2 game very easily and will no doubt remain so for the near future  the only flaw in it is loads of adds and becomes so slow when connected to the internet  but thankfully  the in game adds can be binned for a small fee but it also plays fine offline 
your new update sucks it s now impossible to loot 2m in 4 hours  wtf  are you kidding me supercell  no more dead bases and spent 500k to find a semi dead base with 180k loot  dafuq u     
mms failure still have issues with group messaging and images  even tried fixes proposed on google product forum  it s shocking this is a primary mobile app on the platform google can t get it right  i m on a nexus 6p also so no good hardware excuses 
smh linkedin will not allow me to send connection request through android  but on the other hand i am able to send connection request via ipad  hello    please fix   the new set up is fancy but horrible 
i have had to uninstall this app twice this week because whenever i try to edit a post  the post doesn t edit and just stays gray and stuck in the loading process forever  my o c d  can t handle that    
updates poorly current update clears the cache forcing you to log in again  and of course i have not logged in in over three years and don t know the password   try to do a password reset and the app says the email is not valid   why would you clear auto login information in an update 
nice app i suggest you to add a word count feature and font size  i think it s essential feature for a note app  but  well  keep the good things up  you ve done a really amazing job  thanks                      
thanks u so much for adding sanshkar fm kalaiya all in one ones app thanks so much dont update its great version
sony xperia z1 very good as always  but since last update i can t seem to be able to change the ringtone  reverts back to default
why change it  i use this for my facebook as it s a lot faster than any other app  but now when i try to add a pic the whole format on opera mini has changed  i can t even see the pic i want to choose now and have to go through so many folders as well  go back to the old format  why fix something that wasn t broken  
fail on every update it was best app before you received messages but when you reply it wont send  video calling auto exit now even with good signal  it was very good before 
it s notification system is so poor  it doesn t notify me when any message arrives  no it s too slow to chat also 
good this is a very good app so far  great features and overall performance 
doesn t seem to work at all  no widget and doesn t sync with site 
download stops the iteam iam downloading stop half way or about 13 percent or it just does begin at all  please fix this and ill rate it 5 stars
save image and low performance can not save an image from google image and performance google search very heavy for low devices  i miss opera classic 
dami xa hajur harule ni hernu hai

great app love it  does what it says  of course it s going to be slow if the connection isn t fast enough  it works well for me and my family who are overseas 
good app for free this is a great collabo app  especially since it s free   i asked for 2 things and slack delivered  1  proper gif viewing 2  ability to change profile pic from app   functionality complete 
keep calm and play temple run it s really fun    the graphic is great  and you ll never feel boring with that game

totally loved it but        how to open new tab in lollipop  in kitkat to open new tab we have to swipe down form up but after i updated my software i can t find it  plz reply fast
want to get all 5 stars       reduce the amount of time it takes to upgrade buildings instead of days put it hours i e town hall level 6 takes 4 days put it four hours i never saw a game that goes more than 4 days to upgrade something  each month i will remove 1 star if you do not fix it
cant use not being able to call any contact please try to fix  then ill give all stars
excellent app but still needs a bit more work   keyboard is fantastic and english to nepali conversion is pretty accurate   my only comment on improvement is that you need to improve usability and make it more smooth when typing  i want to just use this keyboard even when typing english but unfortunately  its not just there yet with samsung or google keyboards   also like google keyboard  if you add the feature to switch between keyboard by long pressing a button  it would be really helpful   then it ll get 5 stars  good stuff nonetheless 
forgot my old wechat password  i want to reopen old wechat me    but  i forgot my password for wechat old    my old wechat info also incomplete    there is no link with facebook    i have no qq id    telephone numbers also do not update    but i remember my id    how can i go back    please help me       
one of the best apps ever at first i was a bit skeptical but i got used to it and now i can t work without it  better even than onenote  at least for what i m concerned 
lovely a lovely game for all i love this game so much and my mom too   my mom also enjoy this game so much   thank you rovio team to make this kind of game  
don t like the new look looks like a cheap dating site now  professional vibe is gone  poor facebook knockoff is here to stay  it s not just the aesthetics but the design as well  simple things  like viewing my connections or viewers  require more time  more taps  and more effort than before  others  connections are listed seemingly randomly  making it arduous to find anyone  it s worse on iphone  where speed is at a snail s pace  linkedin has lost its identity  and if it continues in this direction  it will lose its userbase too 
major flaws constant updates and always getting not installed messages   i can use it for awhile and then it s no longer installed   none of my other apps do this 
improve    please add a feature where we can see online contacts only we are tired of searching contact and knowing that whether it is online or not   thanks  
we have wifi with full internet connection  and it always says connecting on the top  i cant send messages  fix this  as in right now  this did not happen before the update 
nice game     its simply amazing   but i would like it better if we had custom options for graphics  it runs extremely smooth but the developer should go easy on the memory that is  it takes more space now than ever before  but overall its an epic game 
unstable call connection it s showing an unstable call connection message on screen whenever i try to call my dear ones  then it s getting worse and leading into self disconnection of calls  i hope u guys notice it and make sure the problem should be solved
sort it out why can i not get my networks posts in recent order on my mobile app  on my pc it happens  why am i looking at post from 1day ago before  posts say happening 1 hour ago  this is so annoying  how do you sort it out  also your help centre on mobile  is not working hence i have had to resort to this  what is going on 
messed my phones default screenshot setting up i installed and everything was great until i noticed when i held down power plus home  which used to take a screen shot  now my phone wants to do a firefox search with this command  after calling samsung there is no way to fix this short of a factory reset and losing all my data  thanks firefox 
two stars cuz after the update it isnt working properly it remains connected but when i send a msg it is automatically disconnectec and ths msg takes aprrox 2 mins or more to send   plz fix this prob as soon as possible   tnx
keeps crashing it only works well in extreme data savings mode  in high data savings mode it keeps crashing and sometimes websites dont load please fix this or i am moving to another browser 
great app saves me when i m on the field because i don t have to rush back to my office to look at certain things 
want to know why did the other people i can see only 10 post and i can t like or comment their post   is that mean their unfriend me or something wrong with that  
widget sabotaged this app functions ok as a note taker  i access it primarily through its widget  the old widget was great  giving a peek at a few recent notes  then that widget was killed off  and replaced with a widget that shows only the titles of 2 recent notes  with maybe just part of the title of a third note  and no content at all  it shows poor judgment for a company to downgrade its product for no apparent reason  also  there s no undo button 
bookmarks the option to open a bookmark in a new tab is taken away  i use that feature and would like it back  also  now the keyboard opens automatically  which i often don t want and have to close it 
yup first thing i thought of for comment was freedom of choice very important some of the people making choices for us are not well   the i thought tony bennet   the good life    to be sussinct   
very useful  
great app the latest update to slack has enabled an in app experience for gifs and while it isn t the smoothest implementation it is definitely a step in the right direction  really enjoy using the app and their responsiveness to user comments makes this a great experience 
huh  i don t get it  i put a password on it and when you go in directly it s required but accessing through my s5 s my files it s there at the bottom under cloud storage and there is no password required  how do i stop this security weakness 
brilliant app brilliant app for browsing and for fb downloading is fastest compared to other browsers one thing it has to improve is that it should be made safer for browsing nd some web pages does not open in this browser 
continually fails to upload files great when it works but i have had enormous trouble with getting it to auto upload from my phone  usually i have to uninstall then reinstall to get this function   which is the one that i use dropbox for the most   to work  very annoying 
it s okay but i wish there s a way to archive notes so my notebooks don t get cluttered up  and how about viewing options like grid view  so i can view my notes and notebooks in grid view  please make these things possible  i m sure i m not the only one who would like that 
love it you are able to see celebrity tweets and get info you didn t know    i love it
frequently resets once again  it has reset and taken all stored boosters  this has gone on about four times now within a couple of weeks of each other  i don t understand why that information isn t stored  since things like your level and gold are retained 
showing old news why is it showing that someone responded to my comment a week ago  i m not getting any crashing but its showing stuff from a week ago on top of my news feed 
shab i have firefox on all of my devices and its more safer than the internet explorer  i like it i just wish it had more functions like free spyware  anti virus 
totally diferent from the web page do not use this app  use the web page instead  you will be able to do much more from there  it is almost impossible to apply to a job from here 
posting issues for the last week  there s been a ghost post at the top of all my feeds from when i uploaded a photo  closing the app fully has not fixed it  and it doesn t happen on any other platform  trying an uninstall to fix it 
shake function not working  my we chat was update few weeks ago since that time i m unable to use shake function  when i use it its just status looking for people shaking their phone but no members pop s up  please fix this  
really great  twitter is an amazing app which i use frequently each day  i do have problems with it though   this is personal preference  whenever i refresh the page  it gives me a tweet with the subtext  twitter name  follows  twitter name  and it happens every time i refresh  so can you only do it once since it clogs my feed with it whenever i want to see new tweets  othe than that its fine 
very useful thank god i can finally reply faster with this  thanks for the updates
facebook ripoff used to see my connections new connections in news feed  now all i see is silly opinion posts   no longer a networking site at all    
weather didn t show please fix it
the best i agree totally with the last poster  chrome is simply the best for android   period  i ve tried all the other crap out there and yeah they have some more features none of which i ever used  i have chrome on my laptop and pc and all of this is synced together  simple  direct and to the point and that s what i like and don t forget very fast 
such an awesome game love it a really fun games definitely suggest any reader of this description to get it is so good you will enjoy the game and it doesn t feel like a waste of time afterwards it is very easy to play and it s very fun to find ways to knock down the building just by using one bird thoroughly recommend it it is very fun and you re so good so please download this game will be blessed
we have a problem  so i ve noticed that twitter will let me like nonspecific things until i m blue in the face  but liking certain specific things get me booted from the app and i have to log back in  let me repeat that  like certain specific things gets me logged out and i have to log back in  what s going on  twitter support 
connection issues app always says can t refresh now  try later which in particular has to do with the net  but my wifi works well enough  i can even play online games  i can refresh my feed at ig and twitter so why can t i refresh my fb feed  fix it please 
ads placement is anoying we know ads was one of your source of income  but placing ads in replies is taking anoying and greed to another level  facebook had more ads  but have you ever see them in the comments section 
great little game  this is a great little game   i am completely addicted to this game   it s simple enough to learn  but has enough variety to keep you  interested   this is an ad supported game  just so you know   i would be happy to buy the game together rid of the ads  however i haven t found where to do that yet 
no respect for privacy linkedin takes advantage of how android manages permissions as well as using an persistent opt out mechanism to aggresively scan your phone s contacts in order to constantly nag about inviting them whilst the app harvests your data  the practices are unethical and makes one question how the company treats private data  linkedin is an important tool to use today but with the way the company behaves  it is better to uninstall the app and rely on the web version when its needed 
some issues i love this app but i have been having some issues lately  it has started telling me that hangouts is no longer supported by google play  you can not send a video  and when on a video chat it seems to lag really bad  wish we had something like imessage in our regular text and facetime 
buggy when i edit a post through the mobile app  that post freezes and even restarting the phone doesn t resolve   unfreeze  this doesn t happen via the desktop app on my pc  not did it happen with previous android app version 
amazing game awesome game so entertaining and very fun  this app is my favorite game  i hope evrybody put s a 5 star for rating because this app is cool 
it was a gud game  but slowest game on this planet  now new update make it more slower  u can t use spells to steal gold or elixir  duration for upgrading is high   m deleting this game n i won t recommend anyone to play this game  
chat why you would make it so it changes the chat colour and name  for both people i have no idea  update it so changes only the person doing it and will be 5 
call disconects in every 5 seconds thats two beep sound is now one of my most hated sound from viber  can t u guys fix it before i uninstall the app and use other app
great application  but the premium notifications have become too invasive  leading to unpleasant clutter  alternative options are becoming much more attractive due to this 
issues with address book contacts i have turned off the feature to update my android contacts based on linkedin information  but it still keeps updating with unwanted title on my address book  i have uninstalled the app n reinstalled it  cleared the data for the app but made no difference  i am using galaxy s6 and would really appreciate if anyone can solve this issue  the best option seems to uninstall the app for good and use just the broswer 
rocking this app is the best among all the news apps
very good  esp with penultimate i really like the cross device syncing and how easy it is to use  please don t make this microsoft word  its great as it is  i esprcially like being able to work in penultimate and find it in evernote with everything else
keeps updating updates all the time  slows my phone as it s doing it to a crawl  installs for like 3 minutes  and the updates never produce anything different or anything of use  the only app on my phone that i have issues with 
always fun  but    i like this new frozen shadows  but the depth perception is not so good  it s hard to see an approaching corner  other then that small bug  i love this game and will continue to play it 
old is best old version  is better then this version
keeps crashing ever since i started using it more  it will crash every ten minutes  its starting to get more annoying  however it is convenient for saving text messages since i don t have unlimited messaging
new menu sucks for power users 
good app but          why do post come up in a random order on the home screen  i have 4 day old posts at the top and have to scroll down to find new posts which are buried between 1 day to 1 week old posts  it needs to have an option for what order you want the posts in 
usefull no others app like this    
changeable it really change our way of getting news
very useful for watching tv reading saptahik kantipur
not the same with my hand on my heart  i can honestly say that the first angry birds was great  the latter is a horrible mess of horrible games cashing in on the original success  unfortunately  this hame has suffered the same fate    it is no longer the brilliant game it once was    it s  an updated version  with none of the original stuff that once made it great   
the only and major problem is it can t provide real time notification   but i love the web desktop notification very much  
very useful i haven t used it as much as i could  but even for what i do  evernote is one of my favorite apps of all time  they just keep making it better and better  their widgets make the all even cooler 
ugly design  no autoimport from old install  iphone ui design in the android app   come on   one day it suddenly wouldn t start   just showed globe and quit  nothing similar has happened with alternative apps  on top of that when i reinstalled it ignored the user folder so even though pics  and supposedly chat  is in there wechat did not read the folder so it s all empty in chats inside wechat after a reinstall  awful 
every time i play the moon struck game  it doesn t give me all the moves  takes my game and makes me lose  please fix this and i will give 5 stars 
doesn t work anymore before the last update it worked just fine on my tablet but now it will start to open then close down 
video issues since i was forced into this update the videos play with a black box in the middle of them  i edited a photo and its grayed out and stays at the top of my news feeds and my timeline it won t even let me delete it  if i could give a zero star i would  just like ever update something is always not working  if its not broke why fix it 
multitab button on top right side is missing    so u cant switch between multiple tabs easily bcoz the small box on the top right corner  that tells u how many tabs r open  isn t there any more  also  when u play video in a website  the audio and video wont be moving at the same speed  meaning the video frams will move ridiculously slow while audio plays at regular speed  i guess thats the problem with the flash player  overall poor web experience with this browser 
profile issues samsung galaxy s4 active  so every time i post a pic on fb it says not available and i can t even edit it  it shows some gray part on top  plzz fix it  i would of rated a 5  but since this happened  i rated 2   
average not so good for watching online videos for watching videos i would prefer stock aosp google browser or uc browser   mx player 
kinda like a 2d kingdom havoc fun   if kingdom havoc was 2d and used a sling shot  it d be close   angry birds is crazy good though   a handful of colorful birds with different and interesting superpowers keep things fresh from level to level   this game gets more difficult along the way  but it s cool to get better as you practice 
on sgh i727 android 4 1 2 the new platform showing all contacts reduced your rating not just like the online status that doesn t give us option to identify our contacts that are online without having to tap on contacts one by one to see there  individual online status and without necessarily having your disable enable our personal settings  useless option that doesn t work    frustrated users ratings going lower and lower  loosing your edge specialy with no response from you  other than the automated generic in privaye email
slow  with weird lack of features    really slow  not sure why  has good search bar  but no way to add search engines  cannot download images from google search  no problem  downloading from bing  it seems there are good feature spread between this and opera mobile  combined they would make a good browser  but independently they re not good enough 
camera option is horrible you can t crop the image sideways    it has to be perfect square or rectangle   camscanner or microsoft lens are  better options for document images  and it needs notebooks within notebooks  the camera flash always on  and when you do needs it  it takes very long time to turn itself off after taking the picture  the document camera likewise needs to detect the edge of the document  editing the images must be done within the interface without going through skitch 
can t connect right now when trying to open links in the facebook browser  i receive a can t connect right now error message  other items on my news feed continue to load 
causes a lot of battery drainage so i love firefox both on pc and android but i ve noticed recently that firefox has been draining a lot of my battery  before this was never an issue  firefox always ran smoothly but now certain webpages with glitch out  jump back up to the top of the page on random  or just not load completely  i ve checked my wi fi and data so that isn t the issue  it seems like the app is working harder than it needs to and it always makes my phone very hot
great features on firefox usually i use chrome that it s a great app  but now firefox upgrade with great features  include video player better and downloading  you can install and experience yourself  have fun and give them a great vote 
add    search people if you don t have the persons number   but they have whatsapp you should be able to search their name and then   add them or something   then it would be 5 stars    
new theme its a fun game       its great to see some new items added to the game  the frozen shadows makes the new challenges a lot more fun 
too bad but improving the earlier version was so nice  i have been using that one since the days of nokia symbian  the new one is double the size and takes more space  it s not even as fast as the earlier one  what a shame  seems improved after update 
if chat at wechat no simbol or bluetick seen so we dont know if we ve been reading text or not so i hope this apps can do diffrent thing right now
my texts aren t delivering  i ve checked my internet connection   its working just fine  please fix it   i ll give a 5  thank you
organization logo whenever i try to add my organization  on my status it displays linkedin s organization logo  however on my profile the logo isn t there and it looks very plain  can someone explain to me why this may be happening    this is on a desktop  by the way

custom emoji doesn t work my custom emoji doesn t show up in preview  and some of them become blank  i cannot send the emoji now  please try to fix the error 
good but ui ease of use still declining i ve used evernote for years and it s power is still there in its ability to find notes but its ui is still in steady decline with a lack of ease of use  needs cleaner  cleaner separation of functionality  nowadays i m having to dbl click a found note to view instead of a single click showing the note content  disappointing to see this once magnificent software reduced to the current level of ui confusion that  so many other programs exhibit as well 
not supported my phon galaxy core i have been use face book last one year  resantly i have a problam  so i will create a new account   now that  is in a same problam  any time asking a conformation code  what s going on  plz answer me  plz help me  now what i do           sent the anwer my email
absolutely the best for saving documents  forms  notes or whatever it is that you may end up needing on the go   you can have one or twenty different books to store and organize your information in   edit word and excel documents without having to save them to your computer and save them again into your books   tag one document in ten different locations so if you can use it in multiple different situations you don t have to worry about where you saved it   just look it up under the tag that you need to use it for   it s that easy  
very good  but reposition and either fix or remove the  share link  button  the  bookmarks not syncing  issue was fixed a while back  i have been happy with this app for a while now  i just forgot to change my previous review  that isn t to say that it is without its problems  however  having gotten used to chrome  i find myself pressing  share link  rather than  open link in new tab   while this normally isn t a problem  lately pressing  share link  causes the app to crash  please either fix this issue and reposition  share link  lower or remove it altogether 
not a fan of new update new update makes it difficult to progress unless you attack several times during your shield period   i can t get ahead  i play twice a day if i can   can t commit to getting on 4 6 times a day 
the best mobile browser ever opera mini is still the best mobile browser in terms of data saving  however  the browser doesn t support gif animation image  it doesn t support themes  night mode is not impressive  saved pages should be accessed locally and transferable to other opera mini device browser  above all it s a good browser with beautiful ui  it s my number one choice browser  thumbs up guys 
this country not allowed  i would have given it 5 stars because my searches and browsing are spot on but it took me to back up account and when i put my backup e mail in it said this country not allowed  im in america  wtf    
please fix this new version  new version seems not good  i cannot open my viber account  when i tried to open it  it ll automatically stopped  please fix this one  thank you 
2many adds  great game ruined by too many adds  way too many adds now  not even fun anymore  was great  now it s terrible 
what s app is not in it s format in my mobile massages are sending through left side and all the layout of what s app is starting from left while in my old mobile all is in right side  i feel so much trouble due to this
nice   but one request    plz include  find text  option in page   as in pc s browsers we press  ctrl f  to find the text in the browser s page   there should be an option of video quality adjustment in settings 
video player issue guys  this is unbelievable    every time when i updated  my video player it doesn t work  now if i do full screen video start stops every 10 sec  is just imposible watch  i really don t know what kind of update is this  happens exactly the contrary that you affirm 
fix some things one letter is capitalized and it goes back again to lowercase  emoji donot appear when i send them box appears but not emotions and include more emoji
favorite menu update is suboptimal the new update puts the entire list of favorites into view from most recent instead of returning me to my previous folder which it always has  this requires more time and clicking to get to the desired folder  please give an option to return it to the previous version 
occasionally i won t receive a notification of a message s  so i don t know that someone has replied until i actually open the app and then suddenly lots of messages come through    5 stars if that can be fixed
viber s a r l  this app helps me to stay in contact while also having video options and picture options  really nice app and pretty stable running  just a few video and audio issues as well as video and call drops which can be annoying  sometimes the app is unstable but is mostly attributed to network issues rather than the app itself  i recommend this app 
between  android or windows10 my tablet or my phone  i love instant access  fantastic simple to use app 
very solid my one real complaint is no way to make anchor tags within a note so i can make a table of contents  otherwise great application 
makes everything so easy slack is easy to use and has all the right  ridiculously well polished  features  and it s backed by a genuine  caring and honest team  it almost seems like they want you to be happy even  after  you give them your money  crazy 
cool really great and awesome graphics  offline is great for going to a no wifi place love it
cant see new emoticons i have a sony xperia z3 and i cannot see the new emoticons  i have updated it twice sinxe the release and cant see them  even my friend with his crapberry can see them but i cant  i will give the app 5 starts if you can fix it 
great app but    i heard that apple added some amazing emojis but i ve been complaining about not seeing some emojis my iphone friend users send and it bothers me  so can you just add those new emojis please  thank you 
buggy after update after the update chrome will freeze chrome isn t responding which gives me an option to wait for it or kill the app  this happens every time i reopen the app and some times from recent
browser gone back downhill constantly hangs now after last update and fc  still does not keep pages in memory when app minimised which is a pain when streaming music etc  app does not use user input options  ignores them  again  still no propper changelog for  latest version either in playstore description or on mozz s www  page   shame that ff are not listening to its users and seem totally ignorant to the fact that there is a rating system on playstore   also they keep editing my review        
bad new update  sight by swipe in chats gone please put back the option where users could quickly record a sight just swiping down on the chats screen  it s horrible to try to record a sight now  having to go through so many screens  by the time it s open now  the moment is gone  i ve missed many moments i would have recorded before  why change something that works well and not broken 
too many updates of too big size please only send updates that are really really necessary  last one 40 22mb   if every app   which it seems it is   keeps doing updates we all end up with no room on our devices  having 15mb of languages i am never going to use is a waist of memory  
very good apps    obviously  no doubt it is very useful apps for those who loves nepali language and want to write nepali   thanks for it n waiting another useful apps like this     
update does not address facebook issue sadly you all seem not to care that your game is now limited by mandatory facebook connection that doesn t work  deleting now   
fantastic and helpful i find this app so helpful  i have the paid version  wouldn t really want the free version  as i love being able to take photos of business cards and turn them into contacts  it also has the ability to find text within pdfs  which is also extremely useful 
like the new update the latest update fixed all of issues that i previously mentioned  no real problem  even while using project fi 
can t download pics i used to be able to download pics from a conversation and save them to my phone  i don t have that option anymore  long press gives me about every other option but not the option to download
doesn t refresh properly i added a few contacts but they don t show up on whatsapp   i hit the refresh button  but no luck 
well done nicely designed      this app had collected daily used collection of apps    liked it 
what s new  broken  differently  again   too bad google is such a small company it doesn t have the resources to create a good product  the latest update has now made the camera go almost black and the speaker has stopped functioning  i have to hold the phone up to my ear to hear the other person 
i ve used firefox on all my mobile devices and computers for years  but since this latest update it s become unusable on my galaxy note 10 1   links either don t work or take you to a different link on the page and the tops   bottoms of pages are obscured so only around a third of the page is visible and search boxes can t be accessed   i hate the idea of changing to chrome etc  but my tablet has been rendered useless for browsing  please sort it out mozilla 
loading login i re download because my wechat is full   when bufring loading   always stuck at 2  and 3  then force close  pls fix it   i will give 5star if u fix it 
poor data wifi transition still doesn t work with wifi networks  even the socket http protocol doesn t help  please learn from whatsapp 
need more hey    its preety awsm but plz develop the download task as fast as uc browser big verson
possible solution to trounle entering site i like this ap    one reviewer says he couldn t get in after installing it   at installation i was asked if i wanted to go through google  or facebook  i think    i choose google   now when i call it up  there is a link to sign up here   if i press click on that link  it opens my todo page   try that 
nice app
not for me i thought its better than multi language keyboard but its nowhere close to it  main problem is that it does not follow the traditional nepali keyboard pattern    this may be enough for some to  post a short comment but not enough for the ones who likes to write in correct nepali 
terrible worst app ever 45 mins trying to back up photos  wont drag and drop from pc or mobile  will only let you highlight 1 at a time  what fool designed this to be easy  maybe it does but its not clear onedrive app so much better and simple  all you want is it to run in background but its a joke 
like button the like button  you know the thing that you can actually change now with a sticker ie snowman  after the update it has never worked on me  i ve tried uninstalling and reinstalling and nothing it still don t work
very good aap i can delete my importent picks without aney kind of risk just beacouse of drop box
great game  really dislike the ads  i usually don t  write reviews  but this time i am because it s getting  ridiculous  every few rounds you play an ad will pop up out of nowhere while you are playing and interrupt your playing sessions making it extremely annoying  i know the ads help with money but  at least reduce the amount of time until the next ad pops up  and force s you to watch it 
one account for all devices
best free note ever     sometimes evernote pop up to purchase premium but its not annoying    features and multiple devices support are very wide use  awesome and i love it 
very smooth i d say it s much better than just uc browser which loads pages as if you are on your laptop with a really bad server  love everything about it  
wrong details of last seen after upgrading to new version    if som 1 sends u msg   and u see that msg after an hour   u will see that sender is online   and after few minutes it will shw tht person is just offline   on tge othr hand   sender has not online since he had send the last msg    resolve it soon
not able to play  automatic closing since last two updates  not abke to play game  it closed suddenly in between automatically 
image search on verizon ellipsis 10 tablet doesn t function properly when an image search is conducted images appear in gray scale or b w with a checkered background 
wechat 6 3 with wechat out is no longer free hate it for wechat out now as it s no longer free which playback sound of video is muted after finishing call with wechat out  why charge when it s not up to mark yet 
it sucks  i am always shown offline and unable to send a single message  to my team 
ok for the simple stuff  feature lacking and poor layout for your basic messaging it s fine  but it still lacks sending voice messages and video clips  can be a bit slow to load conversations  overall the recent changes in ui make it feel cloogy  simple actions like opening the app or going back to the message listview shows a signing in spinner    which is obviously not ideal for every other action  especially since it uses google auth services     
bug   i ve updated my messenger to the latest version but i dont seem to be able to add nicknames or change chat colors  even emojis  yes i am sure that i have the latest version my android is a kitkat  i have seen minor changes but the new features wont show  
it sucks right now the special  levels are rigged  i m sure you can t win just waste your lives and boster f it ready to un install it
another update and still crashing  previously tried    disabled add on  tried re installing  another new update    crashing every few minutes and still can t sync data
whatsapp tips make it as a medium  not base for a friendship  don t stop talking if your friend is not online  find other ways to interact this way even if whatsapp not available  friend will exist 
excellent my entire team would be lost without this  works with web app exceptionally well too 
backing up of messages i dnt know why you even added that message back up  since morning anytime i open my whatsapp a pop up appears backing up my messages which makes me not to be able to read my messages  you could have done it in a way that it work in the background but not popping and thus preventing you from reading your messages   pls  stop  that
bugs with contact syncing very frustrated  after having this app work fine for a couple years  i get an update that screwed up my contacts  i ve read others  comments and the supposed solutions  including uninstalling and reinstalling the app  for a brief few hours last night  it appeared to re sync my linkedin contacts back to my phone contacts  today  gone again  in any case  even when the contacts came back  all my previously set up shortcuts to those contacts were disabled  can you fix this linkedin  i use a samsung galaxy 3s 
worse   1  startup become slow  its mini or not   i guess this apps only for highend device  2  opera config can t be saved 3  font data calculation every time   are you trying to hack me   that all bugs i found for now 
seems to keep crashing    i am a big firefox fan but since i started using the android one here i can no longer watch or stream videos to my tablet  big disappointment indeed 
its suck  any time when i want to see something error will come could not open check your internet satting  else i am using all other applications and other things on net hance i am using 4g network  realy very suck 
the old one is better the previous version kept track of group conversations better   now  i cannot see new activity within groups i follow 
app doesn t work after latest upgrade the facebook app refuses to work on my mobile data  3g  after the latest upgrade  it says it cannot connect right now 
very adventurous game i love it very nice thrilling game everyone should download it and play       very addictive game i just stick on it good graphics and sound improved by the previous part                                
some notification problem although i ve enabled notification   i am not being able to get notification only from ekantipur on my htc desire 826 and it is slower than in other inferior devices  i want to know if this problem is only with me or ekantipur is working on this kind of device  notification feature is very useful for a busy person like me who doesnt get much time to sit back and read news  notifications enables to take a quick look at headlines and understand the situation and can read the selected news according to choice 
great best cross platform cloud storage and has some awesome functionality  it s without a doubt the best cloud storage out there 
privacy at least put some option appear offline  i mean for some people like me it s a big pressure to be seen online like you need to response on every message or else you be called seenzone only  if only i wanna do on facebook is to read on my newsfeed and just wanna response on message i want to  pls reconsidered my review  i tried to turn off chat but still can see me as online 
not able send requests to connect not able to send requests to connect even i uninstalled this app  older version was much much better 
can t get off first base  having give problems synchronizing with the web version   keeps asking for login password and never goes further   reinstalling for last time before i give up
new update sucks     also my base isn t going to my ipad cause your support is rude  title says all  i moved my base to my android cause it got stolen  i bought an iphone and made a new gamecenter account but hey guess what  nope i dont have my first receipt and no i cant tell you the specific date of when i first created my base
not good this app before was no  1  nepali app in android but when they update the app it is now really wasteful after using the app there is no exit  button  please fix it  still  not yet  done the improvements  what s wrong with the app    problem in my  samsung galaxy s3  only   
i wish posts popped up in the order they were posted and not get bumped up to the top every time someone comments on it  i end up seeing the same ones over and over even though they are old and missing newer ones 
firefox is getting better     slowly it crashes regularly  it doesn t play video on youtube  otherwise it is a promising fast browser  i still miss the gestures swipes and a well organized homepage with my selected bookmarks  see ucbrowser hd 
download issues using asus zenfon 5 and several times doesn t let me download anything  shows the text downloading  but doesn t  please fix the issue  otherwise pretty smooth 
tablet support any chance of getting tablet support anytime soon 
unsatisfactory version older version was more user friendly than this one  i can t see my rank among my connection and colleagues  this is really bad  i wish to revert back to old version 
fully ads based even in data connection  and loads pretty badly   i suggest you to look annapurna post beta app  why kantipur network required ads based activities in this app  google advertisement must not be used while using data  and what a load while using this app  kmg app was better than this  i suggest you to look annapurna post beta app    while using from data  first loading the advertisement and after that loading news   what a bullshit coding  fix this for 5 star  
can t log into it tried to reset my password and i can t do it  says that the reset key is expired or not valid   i have all my pictures there     
good but not the better i can t see the videos sometimes  the notifications are bad and always the app isn t responding  this actually is the worst update  please check it
excellent  excellent   excellent    dear sir  hamro patro is almost perfect  towards the perfection  i would like to request you to make the calendar flexible to write on desired dates to use it as planner available in mobile phones  is it possible by your expertise sir 
great but    lags waay too much  i always end up wasting gems when i die because it was lagging  please fix   
awsome but i                                this game but i don t like the frozen bit my sister has had eye site and she can see the normal one and she can t  see the frozen ones so she keeps dieing luckerly we can change back to the normal one but the frozen one takes longer to load so when the frozen whone is out the window i will rate 5 stars but the rest is awesome
this new update i haven t signed into my google account on clash of clans  and since the new update i can t log in  and can t remove the game and download it again because then i will lose everything  please help me get my game to load 
its very helpful

problem i am on a samsung galaxy s6 and now it seems like i can t log in  telling me that my pswrd does not work and when i try to reset it says that the number is banned   really frustrating as i have been on for one day and i thought the app was amazing until now   please tell me how to fix this problem   this app is problematic and no one helps
inferior to desktop browser i love firefox on my desktop but the android version is terrible  1  it crashes constantly  2  scrolling is very jerky  3  on screen rotation the window doesn t resize  4  there is no word wrap when answering certain forums  5  downloaded images are not available for use in forums or whatsapp without rebooting phone  6  pages are very slow to load  both the pre installed samsung browser and chrome are heads and shoulders above firefox  pity 
i do not have word to appreciate this       so just thank u verrrry very very very much founder of its
after observation of all above things v should be hated all that which is outof humanity  n moral ways of  loves on nature s beauty sweety n every mracles  l were created by allahsubhanahutallah  hence v  loves all morally behave  with everyone for deen duniyan n aakhirat for suxess  for all  that  v will get that output  only    for what v  invested input  for the same 
extremely useful app  but has a tendency every so often to glitch out and eat half my battery before i realize what it s doing  also needs to let users define a cap on how much device storage it can hog  i recently discovered this app eating nearly a gig of my tablet s already scarce internal storage  all on its own  i now clear its data manually every few weeks to stop this 
good good for slow connection this uc minilite version does not take much space memory in ram  it is faster also than uc 
it is fine   and getting better   working quite well for me at the minute  i liked the recent layout changes and messaging facilities  websites links are handled better and able to open in browser as well  the problem with notifications still exists   i can t tell if someone accepted my connection request or send me an invitation  notifications appear for a second and go away 
preview not available i cannot view my ms office files  if this problem still exists  will it be more convenient to move all files to one drive 
bullshit update    after updating its totally headache   nt able to download    instead of mobiles its more suitable as pc   when we search anything its always searhing for websites  previously it was asking sepearately for web n image search   apart from this dwnldng is tatal worst as compare to previous version

not happy updated every week they say  erm get more levels added you can do it when not on mobile app and stop taking my  boosters off me lost all my swaps  lollies and colour bombs  get it sorted
very bad i use xperia x8 and i think this app sucks  it never logs in  no matter how many times i change the password it always says it s not the right one  it also is not categorizes as a safe app  since its certificate is different then its name  so the anti virus has to be off for it to connect  futhermore  it has no way to be sync ed to the google account that allows you acces on the internet version 
either make the moving forward process 3 bars or less time to wait you need to change the peramiters to move to the next episode    tired of waiting 3 days as you paid people up with other people who no longer play 
way below expection  why does it lag so much  scroll garda ni freeze hunxa  get it right  kntipur  i expected so much 
stop opening like a full app i used to be able to play music on youtube and answer messages  now it stops the video each time i click on a chat head  if i really wanted to close an app and go to another to answer a message i would use something else

ehhh  at first i gave whatsapp 5 stars  i am now decreasing them to three  there are multiple reasons for this  1  let me send videos no matter how long they are  2  create a feature where i can make custom vibrations for different contacts  3  being completely invisible when i block someone  4  wake screen when i get a message notification  5  if i choose to mark a message as unread  it should reflect to the sender that the message is unread  6  make video chat available  7  update emojis

its really good but   not everyone in your address book is exactly a friend   sometimes u dont want certain people to see ua status or dps    even if u knw them well    so if there could be an additional feature like a favourite list or something like that i would give it a 5 star fo sure   
not enough space 6g is nothing these days  need at least 32g to store all the memory hungry apps as every update gets bigger and bigger as the quality and functionality get smaller and smaller  please dont go to that material crap      not evertone likes the cheap material design  it is designed for lazy devs who like the easy lazy way
annoyed whatsapp used to work great   but with the recent update messages didn t want to come through unless i went into the app  i assumed it was my phone but samsung said everything is working great  so i was advised to uninstall and then reinstall whatsapp  i did just that  it picked up my old number and backed everything up  until it got to the initiating please wait a moment page it s been 3h now and nothing has changed  is there any way to solve this  i would really like to get back online

load shedding widget not syncing the load shedding widget does not sync  otherwise the app is awesome for me 
best apps        apps use                                                                         computer                                                                                                                       
installed and immediately deleted this crap i have used firefox on my desktop for longer then i can remember and i will continue to only use it on my desktop  your only options for a homepage are the crap they want you to see or a blank page with nothing on it and you can t go to a bookmarked website unless you want to go back to their crappy homepage just to see your bookmark list   and did i mention it s crap 
can t switch back you have to go to phone setting to switch to another keyboard  you should add choose input method on keyboard  if i m missing it  teach me how to find that
messenger facebook integration issue ever since the last update  initial received messages don t get pushed to the messenger app and you don t get notification in the facebook app or messenger app  you open the facebook app and happen to see you have a message  you have to click the icon and it opens messenger  subsequent messages go through messenger app  unless you close the chat head    then you start over with no notification and having to go through the facebook app 
not too good  please fix the voice and video calling  and then  you know  it d be nice of there s a kind of sound when a message gets sent  like most texting apps  in this app  though  it just shows now and there s no sound or anything  not a nuisance  but  it s better with a sound 
new version makes it harder to use linkedin especially find the groups you subscribe to and comment in them   submitting issues doesn t seem to work in the mobile app  the submit button is never enabled  this last update was a loser 
nice for the size  it s great   nice ui   small footprint  complain   u belong in scroogle s camp  
too many pop up ads the frequent appearing pop up ads don t allow to read the news smoothly  these ads distract us 
chatheads disappears chatheads keep on disappearing even if i m not closing it  what s the sense of the messenger without that quick access  and the app still force closes itself even at times that imw not using it
fraud  i did not select this app to install  it installed automatically  it will not allow me to uninstall  google fix this   i ll go to the attorney general   this is not right 
they re everywhere i see angry birds everywhere because i can t stop playing this game  get out my head devs  4      because nothing s perfect
can not receive messages    why my message always send to me tomorrow   no today  please fix it it cause me many problem 
almost every time i scroll on a webpage  the copy dialog appears at the top of the page  also i don t care for the new tab opened switch  popup that appears on the screen when i open another tab  i think that should be in the opera mini settings menu 
slowly becoming less and less functional functionality within app seems to be diminishing   hangouts does not automatically compress files being sent via mms which results in many of them bouncing back  muted conversations still ring if a new message is received in a non muted thread  if this is google s way of forcing people to messenger its going to force me off both and i ll use third party apps
contacts sync won t work contacts don t sync anymore  app crashes  i ve tried uninstalling  clearing data and cache  updating but the issue persist  shouldn t had released this version with so many bugs 
can t hook up credit card to wallet unable to connect american express credit card to wallet  get the message system is busy  please try again later      also  why can t we post just at text post to our moments 
not responding occasionally sometimes chrome just won t respond  it doesn t seem to be fixated on a certain website or so  it happens at random  it is far much better than before  and yes it s not my phone s fault as i can just press the home button and operate my phone  no problem there 
unstable  freezes and crashes customisatins and capabilities are unmatched  but seems to freeze way too much atm  some video s won t play that do on other browsers  can t even arrange bookmarks  looking at other browsers now 
not so good remove all contacts please    a lot of ppl hate that soooo much    it s boring and ugly    till i find wanted contact need to search for it 2 minutes   
not able to see recently connected people hi i am not able to see the recently connected people in the notification tab from where i can see the people with whom i connected recently 
1 of our 2 favorite games  it is a delight playing this modern classic that is constantly renewing our interest

can t call i can t  make out going calls to anyone on facebook    when the person im calling answers the call it says contacting then after a few mins an operator says that the person in calling can t be reach and that i have to leave a message after the beep 
good but not great app is awesome  saves me a ton of memory  but i think it should add a few more features to make use even better    1  you should had a select all button when moving upload pics to dropbox albums  its a real pain checking individually 250 pictures to move to album  2   once pictures are in album  the thumnail should sell you how many pictures are currently in that album    if you could do those 2 things    it would be                
can t log in since the latest update i am having trouble logging in  i can t log in my account and it keeps on saying that my phone is not connected to the internet  but when i try open my browser it can connect to the internet  please fix this 
don t use if you have a lot of organized bookmarks they recently changed bookmarks to go to the top of of your bookmarks every time you open a new tab  it used to remember what bookmark folder you were in until a recent update  i also don t like that the folders are now at the top of each bookmark list  i ll be using firefox now 
good app   it s a good app for people especially student like me   but i just think that it would be better if it become more colourful  maybe not too colourful but more colour  it will be more attractive to student like me to use it  thanks for the app btw  
i love this app it is better than tv and old radio
i enjoy twitter but i m extremely annoyed that i can t swipe left or right through an accounts twitter pictures as easily as before  now just tapping the picture takes me to the whole tweet  i have to be super cautious to not accidently tap the picture while i m swiping  it s incredibly annoying  please go back to how it was before  if i were to want see the whole tweet just touch the caption 
too much pop up add average app with too much advertisement  one star for the app and 5 star for the pop up advertisement 
govinda gautam apps is good having facillity of typing  both nepali and english fonts directly  but i couldn t type the half nepali font 
too many ads far more adverts than any other game i ve played  i know it s free and they need the ads to make a profit but there needs to be a balance 
nyc  1 u guys should apply some same strategy as u applied in boom beach  when we use the troops  the remaining undead troops should return to their base  but instead of that  they r dead  fix this for remaining 2 star frm me

all these updates all these updates but still no improvement on high ram usage  it drained battery so much and my phone is very hot when using this messenger only  now there is even a sync issues too it won t sync when it supposed to 
i don t like the new shield system  your base is 100 percent destroyed but the attacker didn t deploy one third of his troops  so you would not get any shield  it does not make any sense to me  i personally don t think shield should be depend on no of troops used 
complete bull was on 1186 and went to play and had lost all my boosters had over 100 different boosters saved up some i payed for never again

privacy its nice how it works with the agenda of your smartphone but  i think they might do something for contacts that didn t have the app and you want them block if they download the app     the same way they give you the option for send invitations  they should have the option for block them   
no notification displayed on system notification panel     after the latest update of version 2 12 367 in asus zenfone 5  i am not able to get notifications of the new msgs received in the notification panel on the upper side  it doesnt get displayed   plzz see to it coz i don t get notified when the msgs have been received  bothering me much

how to upgrade angry birds angry birds is really cool however if you were to upgrade it i would make more birds do different things  second make more challenges and be able to customise your own birds with armour and different powers then  when you know what maps you have to destroy you can choose what bird will be best to use

what happened to you opera    the resent updation make the browser more beautiful to look  than the previous versions  but the smoothness of the browser is gone   yes it have some unique properties whwn compared to other browser such as data saving mode re open closed tab etc   but the problem which i face is that   1  the web pages are not fit to my screen  ie the all the web pages opend through this browser is shows only3 4 part of my screen    2  annoying ads on the home screen of the browser    3  private browsing is not working 
the translation are very hilarious the translations from chinese to english don t make any sense at all    is there any chance we can edit ourselves after noticing it doesn t translate properly 
hamro keyboard this is good app no doubt about it  however adding some features will definitely make it the best app  following are few things observed  1  the option to have the caps lock key enabled should be made available 2  few letters were not available along with words  3  also there are very less options when we go to the numbers option and one of the signs which is missing is the   underscore  4  easy toggle option between the phone keyboard and app keyboard should be made post this it will be 5 star 
all you need  easy and gives you control openness and ease of use are clearly the main goals  the software itself is great  and the various plugins available allow for even more control and customization if you want it  great job 
nice so far  i have been using firefox on my pc for the longest time and love it  and it s no different from the android version  there are a few things i wish were a bit different but all in all i m happy with it

fun but hard angry birds is really fun video game that people from at least 6 year olds and people that are a lot  a lot  a lot of years older than that  just one thing  it s really  really hard  but a challenge can teach children how to control their tempers  even though it can ba a little frustrating

few ui updates 1  group should be included with group status    so that if common event is there then the event can be posted through group status   and group name need not be changed      as it becomes difficult to identify a particular group if a particular festival is there and all group name seems to be similar          2  profile picture and profile status should be at one place not seperate    for status we have shortcut but for profile picture we have to go into settings then profile then comes profile picture

linda cooper hardy it is essential at times  to communicate one person to another   not open to all to read or know   i like that aspect of the messenger field  sometimes on facebook i wish i could have a one to another conversation about   whatever   i find it necessary to discuss more personal subjects that may start on facebook  then end up on messenger   like a phone with no party lines  i would enjoy a privacy option   for now  we have messenger 
gave u too many chances i love desktop firefox  this app is brutally annoying an cumbersome  i ve installed it about 5 times thinking hoping it would get better  there are much better browsers for android than this eg  dolphin or maxthon

surprised been atleast 3 years since i switched to chrome on pc  it was by chance and some luck that i stumbled upon firefox for android  i m absolutely hooked   proper tabbed browsing helps me keep my jungle of open app state screenshots a lot simpler  my favorite feature would be queing new links from other apps to be opened later  neato    made me install firefox again on all my other devices after a long time    good going mozilla      
down to 1 star after backward redesign this app design was perfectly adequate as of fall 2015  then one of these useless all new  redesigns was perpetrated   now the old controls that let me manage the notification sound  silent  vibrate  etc   are nowhere to be found   had to turn off notifications totally to keep my phone quiet  that is unforgivably incompetent   i find the overall design more confusing than prior layout  as many other reviewers do    boo   from 4 stars to 1 
need swipe between images nice app  but it would be really nice if you could swipe between images when viewing them full size 
sometimes  if i turn off wifi  both messenger and fb apps stop responding  and if i dont kill the app and leave it be for a while  it would jam the phone  looking for the cause       
samsung galaxy s5 sm g900f always come back to chrome it just works on so many sites i use  better than the other browsers  but it does need this improved data savings update quick  and the malware blocking which may already be included now  i m not sure   more importantly it needs a ad blocker  but obviously this is going to effect google s business model  a chromium download please 
hooked   but no cutting out it s a fab game and i m hooked but i do get kicked out on occasions part way through a game 
decent  but getting worse with each update  was my undisputed go to app for browsing for the past couple of years until about now  getting buggier with each update  crashes frequently  especially when a lot of tabs are open simultaneously  unresponsive for a few heavy websites  still hoping the devs at google fix this because i m still a huge chrome fan and gonna continue using it 
great and solid app  love the widget  most important feature about this app in my opinion  couple things  number and bullet point lists don t show as formatted when seen on the widget  please fix  also  i d personally like it if emojis were implemented  i d also like it if we had more control over the appearance of the widget  opacity  font size color  background color  
buggy  reinstall several times  issues editing uploaded photo from news feed post  only editable via image caption  then image is greyed out on news feed like it s pending photo upload   won t go away  also can t upload photo from phone gallery  share  to albums  have to open fb   upload photo  select from gallery to add to album 
fun  addicting game i ve played this game for so long  i have everything  there s no way i can complain about a free game  my only wish is that there was a reward for completing the frozen artifacts challenge  i think this happened one other time too but oh well  still a fun game 
regular uc better on powerful devices this is very similar to the regular uc browser in function  in some ways the layout is cleaner especially in the settings menu  the major advantage here is in memory usage typically this will use about 40mb starting up   the regular uc browser uses almost four times the memory  however on my samsung galaxy edge the scroll speed is very laggy and stilted  i love uc but i m sticking with the full version where no such lag occurs  it s probably not fair to compare them on a high end phone however 
great simple and great apps for news lover  i always used to read news from ekantipur website  but now this has made my task times easier  thanks to the developer

this used to be my favorite app    this was the only app that i used for messaging for quite a while  that was all the way up until the notifications stopped working  this has been a major annoyance and has proved to be extremely problematic as well  i love everything about this app apart from the fact that it does not notify me when i get a message  since this is a google application you d think that a bug so simple would be gotten rid of  but i must say  i m quite disappointed with the google team 
why do u do this to me ok so i can t unlock the next episode for 48 hours or i have to pay money to buy gold  so i wait and wait and 48 hours later you tell me to wait 24 more hours because i didn t pay money  so here i m still waiting not going to pay you money  so how long with this take 
ads are way to heavy listen to the bad reviews  there are ads after every round  whether you pass it or fail it  sometimes there are ads before the next round starts to  you spend more time on ads than game play  i develop web apps  and honestly many people rely on ads to make a living  i can appreciate that all to well  however  these developers have went far beyond that  frankly  they are disrespectful nitwits 
   too slow loading webclips       no pdf support at all     even simpler apps do that       web pages that are clipped do not adjust to current window size automatically when window is shrunk or expanded   any program does this   geez       highlighting  needs more colors instead of brown mustard yellow  no customer support responses either  evernote must have been taken over by students  it s not even fun to use anymore because it is slow as hell   this is especially for serious business users  any five star ratings down here must have been given by employees under different themes  this program has really retarded over the years  they need to stick to improving their bread and butter instead of selling side junk and features that are useless  well they got my money this time  so i have to put up with it for a few more months  the lack of pdf support really is terrible for a program like this

could be so much better if they d stop making unneeded changes  while i love twitter  i hate that there is no paid service to remove ads  also there should be a quicker way to access your lists  like a shortcut on the home screen to a specific list would be awesome  and also i ve heard that twitter is testing a non chronological timeline  that is the worst idea ever  if that is implemented without a way to turn it off  i won t use twitter anymore  honestly  if third party apps had push notifications  i wouldn t use the official app at all  oh  and moments is dumb 
just a tool for them to throw ads at you they use this app to electronically monitor your messages looking for key words  once it recognizes a grouping of words it will start to send adds to your news feed that are similar in subject to that of which your talking about in your conversations
use to be a 5 star app i gave this app 1 star and told them i would give more stars after they fixed a particular problem i was having  they fixed that problem  so i upped it to 4 stars  i would give 5  but i m not happy with the changes they made where i now have to use 2 hands to reach for the top of my screen for those functions they use to have on the bottom of the screen  this is the only browser i found that does not have to reload every page when hitting the back button  definite plus 
loved it
nice app  bad notifications i like the browser  but having updated can t recommend anymore  push notified about a competition  no one wants that kind of alert 
not good its previous version  12 0 0 15 14  is much good than that  i can t text directly with current version  please add the inbuilt messenger again in the app
